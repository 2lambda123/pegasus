boto-2.0b3-24047c8.tar.gz

This the the boto library for Amazon AWS. It also supports services
that conform to the AWS APIs, such as Eucalyptus.

This library is used by pegasus-s3.

The version included here (2.0b3-24047c8) is not a released 
version, but rather a snapshot of the boto repository from 
12/15/2010. This library will need to be updated to a formal 
boto release as soon as one is available with support for 
multipart uploads.
