.TH "seqexec" "1" "3.0.0" "Pegasus"
.SH "NAME"
seqexec \- run a bunch of applications
.SH "SYNTAX"
.B seqexec [\-d] [\-f [\-S\~ec]] [\-s\~fn] [\-R\~fn] [inputfile]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The 
.B seqexec
tool executes a list of application in the order specified. It
is generally used to do horizontal clustering of independent
application, and does not care about any application failures.
Such failures should be caught by using
.B kickstart
to start application. In vertical clustering mode, the 
.I hard failure
mode is encouraged, ending execution as soon as one application
fails. When running a complex workflow through 
.BR seqexec ,
the order of applications must be topologically sorted.
.PP
Applications are usually using
.B kickstart
to execute. In the
.B kickstart 
case, all invocations of 
.B kickstart
except the first should add the 
.B kickstart
option
.I \-H
to supress repeating the XML preamble. 
.PP
.B seqexec
permits shell-style quoting. One level of quoting is removed from the 
arguments. Please note that 
.B kickstart
will also remove one level of quoting. 
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.TP
.B \-d
This option increases the debug level. Debug message are generated on 
.IR stdout .
.IP
By default, debugging is minimal.
.TP
.B \-f
In hard failure mode, as soon as one application fails, either through
a non-zero exit code, or by dying on a signal, further execution is
stopped. 
.IP
By default, all applications are executed regardless of failures. 
.TP
.B \-h
This option prints the help message and exits the program.
.TP
.B \-s fn
This option will send protocol message (for Mei) to the specified
file. 
.IP
By default, all message are written to 
.IR stdout .
.TP
.B \-R fn
The progress reporting feature, if turned on, will write one event
record whenever an application is started, and one event record whenever
an application finished. This is to enable tracking of jobs in progress.
.IP
By default, track logs are not written, unless the environment
variable
.I SEQEXEC_PROGRESS_REPORT
is set. If set, progress reports are appended to the file pointed
to by the environment variable. 
.TP
.B \-S ec
This option is a multi-option, which may be used multiple times. For
each given non-zero exit-code of an application, mark it as a form
of success. In 
.B \-f
mode, this means that 
.B seqexec
will not fail when seeing this exit code from any application it runs. 
.IP
By default, all non-zero exit code constitute failure. 
.TP
.B inputfile
The input file specifies a list of application to run, one per line. 
Comments and empty lines are permitted. The comment character is the
octothorpe (#), and extends to the end of line. 
.IP
By default, 
.B seqexec
uses
.I stdin
to read the list of applications to execute. 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.B seqexec
tool returns 1, if an illegal option was used. It returns 2, if the
status file from option
.B \-s
cannot be opened. It returns 3, if the input file cannot be opened. 
It does
.I not
return any failure for failed applications, except in hard failure mode,
where it will return 5 for true failure. The latter is modified by the
.B \-S 
option. 
.PP
The 
.B seqexec 
application will also create a small summary on 
.I stdout
about the success and failure. However, in this case, the field
.B failed
reports
.I any 
exit code that was not zero or a signal of death termination. It
includes non-zero exit codes that were marked as success with the
.B \-S
option.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR kickstart (1).
.SH "CAVEATS"
The
.B \-S
option sets success codes globally. It is not possible to activate success codes
only for one specific application, and doing so would break the shell compatibility. 
Due to the global nature, use success codes sparingly as last resort emergency 
handler. In better plannable environments, you should use an application wrapper
instead.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
The following shows an example input file to
.B seqexec
making use of 
.B kickstart
to track applications.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B SEQEXEC_PROGRESS_REPORT
If this variable is set, and points to a writable file location,
progress report records are appended to the file. While care is
taken to atomically append records to the log file, in case 
concurrent instances of
.B seqexec
are running, broken Linux NFS may still garble some content. 
.TP
.B SEQEXEC_SETUP
If this variable is set, and contains a single fully-qualified path
to an executable and arguments, this executable will be run before 
any jobs are started. The exit code of this setup job will have no
effect upon the main job sequence. 
.TP
.B SEQEXEC_CLEANUP
If this variable is set, and contains a single fully-qualified path
to an executable and arguments, this executable will be before 
.B seqexec
quits. Failure of any previous job will have no effect on the ability 
to run this job. The exit code of the cleanup job will have no effect 
on the overall success or failure state.
