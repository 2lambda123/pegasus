.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The 
.B kickstart 
executable is a light-weight program which connects the
.IR stdin ,
.I stdout
and 
.I stderr
filehandles for grid jobs on the remote site. 
.PP 
Sitting in between the remote scheduler and the executable, it is
possible for
.B kickstart 
to gather additional information about the executable run-time behavior
and resource usage, including the exit status of jobs. This information
is important for the VDS invocation tracking as well as to Condor
DAGMan's awareness of Globus job failures.
.PP
.B Kickstart
allows the optional execution of jobs before and after the main
application job that run in chained execution with the main application
job. See section
.B SUBJOBS
for details about this feature. 
.PP
All jobs with relative path specifications to the application are part
of search relative to the current working directory (yes, this is unsafe),
and by prepending each component from the
.I PATH
environment variable. The first match is used. Jobs that use absolute
pathnames, starting in a slash, are exempt. Using an absolute path to
your executable is the safe and recommended option. 
.PP
.B Kickstart
rewrites the commandline of any job (pre, post and main) with variable
substitutions from Unix environment variables. See section
.B VARIABLE REWRITING
below for details on this feature.
.PP
.B Kickstart
provides a temporary named pipe (fifo) for applications that are gridstart
aware. Any data an application writes to the FIFO will be propagated back
to the submit host, thus enabling progress meters and other application
dependent monitoring. See section
.B FEEDBACK CHANNEL
below for details on this feature. 
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.TP
.B \-n tr
In order to associate the minimal performance information of the job
with the invocation records, the jobs needs to carry which
transformation in the VDC was responsible for producing it. The format
is the notion of VDLt for fully-qualified definition names, like
namespace::name:version, with only the name portion being mandatory.
.IP
There is no default. If no value is given, "null" will be reported.
.TP
.B \-N dv
In order to associate the VDC invocation record of the job with the
invocation records, the jobs needs to carry which derivation in the VDC
was responsible for producing it. The format is the notion of VDLt for
fully-qualified definition names, like namespace::name:version, with
only the name portion being mandatory.
.IP
There is no default. If no value is given, "null" will be reported.
.TP
.B \-H 
This option avoids kickstart writing the XML preamble (entity), if you 
need to combine multiple kickstart records into one document. 
.TP
.B \-R site
In order to provide the greater picture, kickstart can reflect the
site handle (resource identifier) into its output. 
.IP
There is no default. If no value is given, the attribute will not be
generated. 
.TP
.B \-L lbl
.TP
.B \-T iso
These optional arguments denote the workflow label (from DAX) and the 
workflow's last modification time (from DAX). The label
.I lbl
can be any sensible string of up to 32 characters, but should use C
identifier characters. The timestamp 
.I iso
must be an ISO 8601 compliant time-stamp.
.TP
.B \-S l=p
If stat information on any file is required 
.I before 
any jobs were started,
logical to physical file mappings to stat can be passed using the
.B \-S 
option. The LFN and PFN are concatenated by an equals (=) sign. The
LFN is optional: If no equals sign is found, the argument is taken as 
sole PFN specification without LFN.
.IP
This option may be specified multiple times. To reduce and overcome
commandline length limits, if the argument is prefixed with an at (@) 
sign, the argument is taken to be a textual file of LFN to PFN mappings.
The optionality mentioned above applies. Each line inside the file
argument is the name of a file to stat. Comments (#) and empty lines
are permitted.
.IP
Each PFN will incur a 
.I statcall
record (element) with attribute
.I id
set to value
.IR initial .
The optional 
.I lfn
attribute is set to the LFN stat'ed. The filename is part of the 
.I statinfo
record inside.
.IP 
There is no default.
.TP
.B \-s fn
If stat information on any file is required 
.I after 
all jobs have finished,
logical to physical file mappings to stat can be passed using the
.B \-s 
option. The LFN and PFN are concatenated by an equals (=) sign. The
LFN is optional: If no equals sign is found, the argument is taken as 
sole PFN specification without LFN.
.IP
This option may be specified multiple times. To reduce and overcome
commandline length limits, if the argument is prefixed with an at (@) 
sign, the argument is taken to be a textual file of LFN to PFN mappings.
The optionality mentioned above applies. Each line inside the file
argument is the name of a file to stat. Comments (#) and empty lines
are permitted.
.IP
Each PFN will incur a 
.I statcall
record (element) with attribute
.I id
set to value
.IR final .
The optional 
.I lfn
attribute is set to the LFN stat'ed. The filename is part of the 
.I statinfo
record inside.
.IP 
There is no default.
.TP
.B \-i asi
This option allows 
.B kickstart
to re-connect the stdin of the application that it starts. Use a single
hyphen to share 
.I stdin 
with the one provided to 
.BR kickstart .
.IP
The default is to connect 
.I stdin
to
.IR /dev/null .
.TP
.B \-o aso
This option allows 
.B kickstart
to re-connect the 
.I stdout 
of the application that it starts. The mode is used whenever an application
produces meaningful results on its 
.I stdout
that need to be tracked by VDS. The real
.I stdout 
of Globus jobs is staged via GASS (GT2) or RFT (GT4). The real 
.I stdout
is used to propagate the invocation record back to the submit site. Use
the single hyphen to share the application's
.I stdout 
with the one that is provided to 
.BR kickstart .
In that case, the output from
.B kickstart
will interleave with application output. For this reason, such a mode
is not recommended.
.IP
In order to provide an uncaptured 
.I stdout
as part of the results, it is the default to connect the
.I stdout 
of the application to a temporary file. The content of this temporary
file will be transferred as payload data in the
.B kickstart
results. The content size is subject to payload limits, see the
.B \-B 
option. If the content grows large, only an initial portion will become
part of the payload. If the temporary file grows too large, it may flood
the worker node's temporary space. The temporary file will be deleted
after
.B kickstart
finishes.
.IP
If the filename is prefixed with an exclaimation point, the file will
be opened in append mode instead of overwrite mode. Note that you may
need to escape the exclaimation point from the shell.
.IP
The default is to connect 
.I stdout
to a temporary file. 
.TP
.B \-e ase
This option allows 
.B kickstart
to re-connect the 
.I stderr
of the application that it starts. This option is used whenever an
application produces meaningful results on
.I stderr
that needs tracking by VDS. The real
.I stderr
of Globus jobs is staged via GASS (GT2) or RFT (GT4). It is used to
propagate abnormal behaviour from both,
.B kickstart
and the application that it starts, though its main use is to propagate
application dependent data and heartbeats. Use a single hyphen to share
.I stderr 
with the 
.I stderr
that is provided to 
.BR kickstart .
This is the backward compatible behavior.
.IP
In order to provide an uncaptured 
.I stderr
as part of the results, by default the
.I stderr 
of the application will be connected to a temporary file. Its content is
transferred as payload data in the
.B kickstart
results. If too large, only the an initial portion will become part of
the payload. If the temporary file grows too large, it may flood the
worker node's temporary space. The temporary file will be deleted after
.B kickstart
finishes.
.IP
If the filename is prefixed with an exclaimation point, the file will
be opened in append mode instead of overwrite mode. Note that you may
need to escape the exclaimation point from the shell.
.IP
The default is to connect 
.I stderr
to a temporary file.
.TP
.B \-l logfn
allows to append the performance data to the specified file. Thus,
multiple XML documents may end up in the same file, including their XML
preamble. 
.I stdout
is normally used to stream back the results. Usually, this is a
GASS-staged stream. Use a single hyphen to generate the output on the
.I stdout 
that was provided to
.BR kickstart ,
the default behavior.
.IP
Default is to append the invocation record onto the provided
.IR stdout .
.TP
.B \-w cwd
permits the explicit setting of a new working directory once kickstart
is started. This is useful in a remote scheduling environment, when the
chosen working directory is not visible on the job submitting host. If
the directory does not exist,
.B kickstart
will fail. This option is mutually exclusive with the 
.I \-W cwd 
option.
.IP
Default is to use the working directory that the application was started
in. This is usually set up by a remote scheduling environment. 
.TP
.B \-W cwd
permits the explicit creation and setting of a new working directory
once kickstart is started. This is useful in a remote scheduling
environment, when the chosen working directory is not visible on the job
submitting host. If the directory does not exist,
.B kickstart
will attempt to create it, and then change into it. Both, creation and
directory change may still fail. This option is mutually exclusive with
the  
.I \-w cwd 
option.
.IP
Default is to use the working directory that the application was started
in. This is usually set up by a remote scheduling environment. 
.TP
.B \-X
make an application executable, no matter what. It is a work-around code
for a weakness of  
.I globus\-url\-copy 
which does not copy the permissions of the source to the destination. 
Thus, if an executable is staged-in using GridFTP, it will have the
wrong permissions. Specifying the 
.I \-X 
flag will attempt to change the mode to include the necessary x (and r)
bits to make the application executable. 
.IP
Default is not to change the mode of the application. Note that this
feature can be misused by hackers, as it is attempted to call chmod
on whatever path is specified. 
.TP
.B \-B sz
varies the size of the debug output data section. If the file
descriptors
.I stdout
and 
.I stderr
remain untracked, 
.B kickstart
tracks that output in temporary files. The first few pages from this
output is copied into a data section in the output. In order to resize
the length of the output within reasonable boundaries, this option
permits a changes. Data beyond the size will not be copied, i.e. is
truncated. 
.IP
Warning: This is not a cheap way to obtain the stdio file handle data.
Please use tracked files for that. Due to output buffer pre-allocation,
using arbitrary large arguments may result in failures of 
.B kickstart
itself to allocate the necessary memory. 
.IP
The default maximum size of the data section is 262144 byte. 
.TP
.B \-I fn
In this mode, the application name and any arguments to the application
are specified inside of file 
.IR fn .
The file contains one argument per line. Escapeing from Globus, Condor
and shell meta characters is not required. This mode permits to use the
maximum possible commandline length of the underlying operationg system,
e.g. 128k for Linux. Using the 
.B \-I
mode stops any further commandline processing of 
.B kickstart
command lines. 
.IP
Default is to use the 
.I app flags
mode, where the application is specified explicitely on the
command-line. 
.TP
.B app
The path to the application has to be completely specified. The
application is a mandatory option.
.TP
.B appflags
Application may or may not have additional flags.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B kickstart
will return the return value of the main job. In addition, the error
code 127 signals that the call to exec failed, and 126 that reconnecting
the stdio failed. A job failing with the same exit codes is indistinguishable 
from
.B kickstart
failures.

.SH "SUBJOBS"
Subjobs are a new feature and may have a few wrinkles left.
.PP
In order to allow specific setups and assertion checks for compute nodes,
.B kickstart
allows the optional execution of a 
.IR prejob .
This
.I prejob
is anything that the remote compute node is capable of executing. For
modern Unix systems, this includes #! scripts interpreter invocations,
as long as the x bits on the executed file are set. The main job is run
if and only if the prejob returned regularly with an exit code of zero.
.PP
With similar restrictions, the optional execution of a
.I postjob
is chained to the success of the main job. The postjob will be run,
if the main job terminated normally with an exit code of zero. 
.PP
In addition, a user may specify a 
.I setup
and a
.I cleanup
job. The 
.I setup 
job sets up the remote execution environment. The
.I cleanup
job may tear down and clean-up after any job ran. Failure to run the
setup job has no impact on subsequent jobs. The cleanup is a job that
will even be attempted to run for all failed jobs. No job information is
passed. If you need to invoke multiple setup or clean-up jobs, bundle
them into a script, and invoke the clean-up script. Failure of the
clean-up job is not meant to affect the progress of the remote workflow
(DAGMan). This may change in the future.
.PP
The setup-, pre-, and post- and cleanup-job run on the same compute node
as the main job to execute. However, since they run in separate
processes as children of
.BR kickstart , 
they are unable to influence each others nor the main jobs environment
settings.
.PP
All jobs and their arguments are subject to variable substitutions as
explained in the next section.
.PP
To specify the prejob, insert the the application invocation and any
optional commandline argument into the environment variable 
.IR GRIDSTART_PREJOB .
If you are invoking from a shell, you might want to use single quotes
to protect against the shell. If you are invoking from Globus, you can
append the RSL string feature. From Condor, you can use Condor's notion
of environment settings. From VDS, use the 
.I profile
command to set generic scripts that will work on multiple sites, 
or the transformation catalog to set environment variables in a pool-specific
fashion. Please remember that the execution of the main job is chained
to the success of the prejob. 
.PP
To set up the postjob, use the environment variable 
.I GRIDSTART_POSTJOB
to point to an application with potential arguments to execute. The same
restrictions as for the prejob apply. Please note that the execution of
the post job is chained to the main job. 
.PP
To provide the independent setup job, use the environment variable
.IR GRIDSTART_SETUP .
The exit code of the setup job has no influence on the remaining chain
of jobs. To provide an independent cleanup job, use the environment variable
.I GRIDSTART_CLEANUP
to point to an application with possible arguments to execute. The same
restrictions as for prejob and postjob apply. The cleanup is run regardless
of the exit status of any other jobs.
.SH "VARIABLE REWRITING"
Variable substitution is a new feature and may have a few wrinkles left.
.PP
The variable substitution employs simple rules from the Bourne shell
syntax. Simple quoting rules for backslashed characters, double quotes
and single quotes are obeyed. Thus, in order to pass a dollar sign to
as argument to your job, it must be escaped with a backslash from the 
variable rewriting.
.PP
For pre- and postjobs, double quotes allow the preservation of whitespace
and the insertion of special characters like \\a (alarm), \\b (backspace),
\\n (newline), \\r (carriage return), \\t (horizontal tab), and \\v 
(vertical tab). Octal modes are 
.I not
allowed. Variables are still substituted in double quotes. Single quotes
inside double quotes have no special meaning.
.PP
Inside single quotes, no variables are expanded. The backslash only
escapes a single quote or backslash. 
.PP
Backticks are not supported.
.PP
Variables are only substituted once. You cannot have variables in
variables. If you need this feature, please request it. 
.PP 
Outside quotes, arguments from the pre- and postjob are split on linear
whitespace. The backslash makes the next character verbatim. 
.PP
Variables that are rewritten must start with a dollar sign either
outside quotes or inside double quotes. The dollar may be followed by a
valid identifier. A valid identifier starts with a letter or the
underscore. A valid identifier may contain further letters, digits or
underscores. The identifier is case sensitive. 
.PP
The alternative use is to enclose the identifier inside curly braces. In
this case, almost any character is allowed for the identifier, including
whitespace. This is the 
.I only
curly brace expansion. No other Bourne magic involving curly braces is
supported.
.PP
One of the advantages of variable substitution is, for example, the
ability to specify the application as
.I $HOME/bin/app1 
in the transformation catalog, and thus to gridstart. As long as your
home directory on any compute node has a
.I bin 
directory that contains the application, the transformation catalog does
not need to care about the true location of the application path on each
pool. Even better, an administrator may decide to move your home
directory to a different place. As long as the compute node is set up
correctly, you don't have to adjust any VDS data.
.PP 
Mind that variable substitution is an expert feature, as some degree of
tricky quoting is required to protect substitutable variables and quotes
from Globus, Condor and VDS in that order. Note that Condor uses the
dollar sign for its own variables. 
.PP
The variable substitution assumptions for the main job differ
slightly from the prejob and postjob for technical reasions. The pre-
and postjob commandlines are passed as one string. However, the main
jobs commandline is already split into pieces by the time it reaches
.BR kickstart .
Thus, any whitespace on the main job's commandline must be preserved,
and further argument splitting avoided.
.PP
It is highly recommended to experiment on the Unix commandline with the
.I echo
and
.I env
applications to obtain a feeling for the different quoting mechanisms
needed to achieve variable substitution. 
.SH "FEEDBACK CHANNEL"
A long-running application may consider to stream back heart beats
and other application-specific monitoring and progress data. For this
reason, 
.I kickstart
provides a feedback channel. At start-up, a transient named pipe,
also known as FIFO, is created. While waiting for started jobs to
finish, 
.I kickstart
will attempt to read from the FIFO. By default, any information read
will be encapsulated in XML tags, and written to 
.I stderr .
Please note that in a VDS, Globus, Condor-G environment, 
.I stderr
will be GASS streamed or staged to the submit host. At the submit host, an
application specific monitor may unpack the data chunks and could
for instance visually display them, or aggregate them with other
data. Please note that
.I kickstart
only provides a feedback channel. The content and interpretation
is up to, and specific for the application. 
.PP
In order to make an application gridstart aware, it needs to be
able to write to a FIFO. The filename can be picked up from the
environment variable
.B GRIDSTART_CHANNEL
which is provided to all jobs. Please note that the application 
must be prepared to handle the PIPE signal when writing to a FIFO, 
and must be able to cope with failing write operations. 
.SH "EXAMPLE"
You can run the
.B kickstart
executable locallly to verify that it is functioning well. In the
initial phase, the format of the performance data may be slightly
adjusted.
.nf
\f(CB
$ env GRIDSTART_PREJOB='/bin/usleep 250000' \\
  GRIDSTART_POSTJOB='/bin/date -u' \\
  kickstart -l xx \\$PEGASUS_HOME/bin/keg -T1 -o-
$ cat xx
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
  ...
  </statcall>
</invocation>
\fP
.fi
.PP
Please take note a few things in the above example:
.PP
The output from the postjob is appended to the output of the main job on
.IR stdout .
The output could potentially be separated into different data sections
through different temporary files. If you truly need the separation,
request that feature.
.PP
The log file is reported with a size of zero, because the log file did
indeed barely exist at the time the data structure was (re-)
initialized. With regular GASS output, it will report the status of the
socket file descriptor, though.
.PP
The file descriptors reported for the temporary files are from the 
perspective of 
.BR kickstart .
Since the temporary files have the close-on-exec flag set, 
.BR kickstart 's
filedescriptors are invisible to the job processes. Still, the 
.I stdio
of the job processes are connected to the temporary files.
.PP
Even this output already appears large. The output may already be too
large to guarantee that the append operation on networked pipes (GASS,
NFS) are atomically written.
.PP
The current format of the performance data is as follows:
.SH "OUTPUT FORMAT"
Refer to
.B http://www.griphyn.org/workspace/VDS/iv-1.4/iv-1.4.html
for an up-to-date description of elements and their attributes. Check with
.B http://www.griphyn.org/workspace/VDS/
for IV schemas with a higher version number.
.SH "RESTRICTIONS"
There is no version for the Condor
.I standard 
universe. It is simply not possible within the constraints of Condor. 
.PP
Due to its very nature,
.B kickstart
will also prove difficult to port outside the Unix environment.
.PP
Any of the pre-, main-, cleanup and postjob are unable to influence one anothers
visible environment.
.PP
Do not use a VDL definition with just the name
.I null 
and no namespace or version.
.PP 
First Condor, and then Unix, place a limit on the length of the commandline. 
The additional space required for the gridstart invocation may silently 
overflow the maximum space, and cause applications to fail. If you suspect
to work with many argument, try an argument-file based approach.
.PP
A job failing with exit code 126 or 127 is indistinguishable from
.B kickstart
failing with the same exit codes. Sometimes, careful examination of the
returned data can help.
.PP
If the logfile is collected into a shared file, due to the size of the
data, simultaneous appends on a shared filesystem from different
machines may still mangle data. Currently, file locking is not even
attempted, although all data is written atomically from the perspective
of 
.BR kickstart .
.PP
The upper limit of characters of commandline characters is currently not 
checked by 
.BR kickstart .
Thus, some variable substitutions could potentially result in a
commandline that is larger than permissable.
.PP
If the output or error file is opened in append mode, but the
application decides to truncate its output file, as in aboves example
by opening 
.I /dev/fd/1
inside
.IR keg ,
the resulting file will still be truncated. This is correct behavior,
but sometimes not obvious.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B $PEGASUS_HOME/etc/iv-1.6.xsd
is the suggested location of the latest XML schema describing the data
on the submit host.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B GRIDSTART_TMP
is the hightest priority to look for a temporary directory, if
specified. This rather special variable was introduced to overcome
some peculiarities with the FNAL cluster. 
.TP

is the next hightest priority to look for a temporary directory, if
specified. 
.TP
.B TEMP
is the next priority for an environment variable denoting a

.TP
.B TMPDIR
is next in the checklist. If none of these are found, either the
