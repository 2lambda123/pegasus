.SH "NAME"
pegasus-keg \- kanonical executable for grids
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR [\-a appname] [\-t interval |\-T interval] [\-l logname]
            [\-P prefix] [\-o fn [\&.\&.]] [\-i fn [\&.\&.]] [\-G sz]
            [\-C] [\-e env [\&.\&.]] [\-p parm [\&.\&.]]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The kanonical executable is a stand\-in for regular binaries in a DAG \- but not for their arguments\&. It allows to trace the shape of the execution of a DAG, and thus is an aid to debugging DAG related issues\&.
.sp
Key feature of \fBpegasus\-keg\fR is that it can copy any number of input files, including the \fIgenerator\fR case, to any number of output files, including the \fIdatasink\fR case\&. In addition, it protocols the IPv4 and hostname of the host it ran upon, the current timestamp, and the run time from start til the point of logging the information, the current working directory and some information on the system environment\&. \fBpegasus\-keg\fR will also report all input files, the current output files and any requested string and environment value\&.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.sp
The \fB\-e\fR, \fB\-i\fR, \fB\-o\fR and \fB\-p\fR arguments allow lists with arbitrary number of arguments\&. These options may also occur repeatedly on the command line\&. The file options may be provided with the special filename \- to indicate \fIstdout\fR in append mode for writing, or \fIstdin\fR for reading\&. The \fB\-a\fR, \fB\-l\fR , \fB\-P\fR , \fB\-T\fR and \fB\-t\fR arguments should only occur a single time with a single argument\&.
.sp
If \fBpegasus\-keg\fR is called without any arguments, it will display its usage and exit with success\&.
.PP
\fB\-a appname\fR
.RS 4
This option allows
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR
to display a different name as its applications\&. This mode of operation is useful in make\-believe mode\&. The default is the basename of
\fIargv[0]\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e env [\&.\&.]\fR
.RS 4
This option names any number of environment variables, whose value should be reported as part of the data dump\&. By default, no environment variables are reported\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i infile [\&.\&.]\fR
.RS 4
The
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR
binary can work on any number of input files\&. For each output file, every input file will be opened, and its content copied to the output file\&. Textual input files are assumed\&. Each input line is indented by two spaces\&. The input file content is bracketed between an start and end section, see below\&. By default,
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR
operates in
\fIgenerator\fR
mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l logfile\fR
.RS 4
The
\fIlogfile\fR
is the name of a file to append atomically the self\-info, see below\&. The atomic write guarantees that the multi\-line information will not interleave with other processes that simultaneously write to the same file\&. The default is not to use any log file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o outfile [\&.\&.]\fR
.RS 4
The
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR
can work on any number of output files\&. For each output file, every input file will be opened, and its content copied to the output file\&. Textual input files are assumed\&. Each input line is indented by two spaces\&. The input file content is bracketed between an start and end section, see 2nd example\&. After all input files are copied, the data dump from this instance of
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR
is appended to the output file\&. Without output files,
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR
operates in
\fIdata sink\fR
mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-G size\fR
.RS 4
If you want
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR
to generate a lot of output, the generator option will do that for you\&. Just specify how much, in bytes, you want\&. This option is off by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C\fR
.RS 4
This option causes
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR
to list all environment variables that start with the prefix
\fI\e_CONDOR\fR
The option is useful, if \&.B pegasus\-keg is run as (part of) a Condor job\&. This option is off by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p string [\&.\&.]\fR
.RS 4
Any number of parameters can be reported, without being specific on their content\&. Effectively, these strings are copied straight from the command line\&. By default, no extra arguments are shown\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P prefix\fR
.RS 4
Each line from every input file is indented with a prefix string to visually emphasize the provenance of an input files through multiple instances of
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR\&. By default, two spaces are used as prefix string\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t interval\fR
.RS 4
The interval is an amount of sleep time that the
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR
executable is to sleep\&. This can be used to emulate light work without straining the pool resources\&. If used together with the
\fB\-T\fR
spin option, the sleep interval comes before the spin interval\&. The default is no sleep time\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-T interval\fR
.RS 4
The interval is an amount of busy spin time that the
\fBpegasus\-keg\fR
executable is to simulate intense computation\&. The simulation is done by random julia set calculations\&. This option can be used to emulate an intense work to strain pool resources\&. If used together with the
\fB\-t\fR
sleep option, the sleep interval comes before the spin interval\&. The default is no spin time\&.
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.sp
Execution as planned will return 0\&. The failure to open an input file will return 1, the failure to open an output file, including the log file, will return with exit code 2\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
The example shows the bracketing of an input file, and the copy produced on the output file\&. For illustration purposes, the output file is connected to \fIstdout\fR :

.SH "RESTRICTIONS"
.sp
The input file must be textual files\&. The behaviour with binary files is unspecified\&.
.sp
The host address is determined from the primary interface\&. If there is no active interface besides loopback, the host address will default to 0\&.0\&.0\&.0\&. If the host address is within a \fIvirtual private network\fR address range, only \fI(VPN)\fR will be displayed as hostname, and no reverse address lookup will be attempted\&.
.sp
The \fIprocessor info\fR line is only available on Linux systems\&. The line will be missing on other operating systems\&. Its information is assuming symmetrical multi processing, reflecting the CPU name and speed of the last CPU available in \fI/dev/cpuinfo\fR \&.
.sp
There is a limit of \fI4 * page size\fR to the output buffer of things that \&.B pegasus\-keg can report in its self\-info dump\&. There is no such restriction on the input to output file copy\&.
