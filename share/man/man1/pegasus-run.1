.SH "NAME"
pegasus\-run \- executes a workflow that has been planned using pegasus\-plan.

.SH "SYNTAX"
.LP 
.B pegasus\-run [options] [rundir]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The pegasus\-run command executes a workflow that has been planned using pegasus\-plan. By default pegasus\-run can be invoked either in the planned directory with no options and arguments or just the full path to the run directory. pegasus\-run also can be used to resubmit a failed workflow by running the same command again.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.LP
By default pegasus\-run does not require any options or arguments if invoked from within the planned workflow directory. If running the command outside the workflow directory then a full path to the workflow directory needs to be specified.
.P
pegasus-run takes the following options
.TP
.B \-Dpropkey=propvalue
The \-D options allows an advanced user to override certain properties which influence pegasus\-run. One may set several CLI properties by giving this option multiple times.
.I The \-D option(s) must be the first option on the command line. 
CLI properties take precedence over the file\-based properties of the same key.

Is the full qualified path to the base directory containing the planned workflow dag and submit files. This is optional if pegasus-run command is invoked from within the run directory.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If the workflow is submitted for execution pegasus\-run returns with an exit code of 0. However, in case of error, a non\-zero exit code indicates problems. An error message clearly marks the cause.

.SH "FILES AND DIRECTORIES"
The following files are created, opened or written to :
.TP
.B braindump
This file is located in the rundir. pegasus\-run uses this file to find out paths to several other files, properties configurations etc.
.TP
.B pegasus.?????????.properties
This file is located in the rundir. pegasus\-run uses this properties file by default to configure its internal settings.
.TP
.B workflowname.dag
pegasus\-run uses the workflowname.dag or workflowname.sh file and submits it either to condor for execution or runs it locally in a shell environment

.SH "PROPERTIES"
pegasus\-run reads its properties from several locations.
.TP
.B RUNDIR/pegasus.??????????.properties.
The default location for pegasus-run to read the properties from
.TP  
.B \-\-conf propfile
properties file provided in the conf option replaces the default properties file used. 
.TP
.B $HOME/.pegasusrc 
will be used if neither default rundir properties or \-\-conf propertiesfile are found.
.P 
Additionally properties can be provided individually using the 
.B \-D<propkey=propvalue> 
option on the command line before all other options. These properties will override properties provided using either \-\-conf or RUNDIR/pegasus.???????.properties or the $HOME/.pegasusrc
.P 
.I The merge logic is CONF PROPERTIES || DEFAULT RUNDIR PROPERTIES || PEGASUSRC overriden by Command line properties

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
