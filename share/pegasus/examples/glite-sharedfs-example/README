Purpose
	- An example to submit a blackdiamond workflow directly to
	local PBS using the condor glite functionality

	
Tested with
       - Pegasus 4.2.0
       - Condor 7.9.3 . Should work with stable condor release also.


Setting PBS Parameters for jobs
       - Put the pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh file in the GLITE bin
       directory

       - GLITE directory can be determinged by running
       condor_config_val GLITE_LOCATION

       - The following profiles can be assocaited with the jobs to
         change the corresponding PBS parameters

	 The file format is the foramt for specifying profiles in the
	 properties. Look up the profiles chapter if you want to
	 specify these profiles elsewhere	 

	 #the pbs queue the job runs in 
	 condor.batch_queue   <queue name>

	 # the pbs nodes
	 globus.count  <number of pbs nodes to use>

	 #the number of cpus/procs to use
	 globus.hostcount <number of procs to use>

	 #the maxwalltime for the jobs
	 globus.maxwalltime <walltime in seconds>


	

Before you RUN

       Before you run the example, make sure that the glite bindings
       are  installed in your condor install. Do the following

        -  condor_config_val GLITE_LOCATION
    	this will tell you the glite location

	 -  do an ls in that directory to make sure the binaries
            exists
	    
       Sample Usage
       [vahi@ccg-testing2 ~]$  condor_config_val GLITE_LOCATION
       /usr/libexec/condor/glite

       [vahi@ccg-testing2 ~]$ ls -lh /usr/libexec/condor/glite/
       total 12K
       drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Feb  7 10:20 bin
       drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Feb  7 10:20 etc	
       drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K Feb  7 10:20 share


HOW TO RUN
    ./submit will generate the workflow , plan it with pegasus and
    submit it for execution

    the sites.xml file will have a local-pbs site that designates your
    cluster.
