Purpose
	- This example highlight a simple MPI hello world program that is run through Pegasus.
	  It is setup to submit the MPI job directly to the MIRA BlueGene Cluster at ALCF
	  Utilizes support for cobalt in the Glite interface in Pegasus

	
Tested with
       - Pegasus 4.6.2
       - Condor 8.5.6 . 


Before you RUN
       - Compile the pegasus-mpi-hw.c executable. A Makefile is provided with the example.

       - Make sure you are running HTCondor on the MIRA login nodes miralac1-3

       - Condor needs special configuration to submit to cobalt. Please refer to HTCondor documentation.
         Sample condor configuration files that worked for us are included with the example.
       


HOW TO RUN
         
    # the example directory should be in your home directory
    # or any directory that is mounted both on the  cluster
    # and miralac login node

    ./submit will generate the workflow , plan it with pegasus and
    submit it for execution

    the sites.xml file will have a hpcc site that designates the HPCC cluster.
    
    # HPCC directory will be where the workflow scratch directory is
    
    # the outputs of the worklfow will appear in the outputs directory
