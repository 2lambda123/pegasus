Pegasus Workflow Management System
----------------------------------

Before you try to run anything, you might want to make sure that your
environment works. We depend on a number of packages that you need to have
installed: Condor 7.4+, Java 1.6+, Python 2.4+, Perl 5.6+, and optionally
Globus Toolkit 4.2+.

Please refer to the RELEASE_NOTES for important changes. For instance, it is no
longer necessary to set the PEGASUS_HOME environment variable. However, in
order to find all tools, you must include Pegasus's "bin" directory in your
PATH environment variable.

Please refer to the user guide for instructions on the packages and
their installation. You can find the documentation online at

  http://pegasus.isi.edu/documentation

and in the distributed "doc" directory.
