Hi folks,

you need at least a version 5.6.0 of Perl to be able to run things.

Futhermore, if your version of Perl is below 5.6.1, you will need to
install the File::Temp module, a copy of which can be found in the
contrib directory. Please refer to its readme file for installation
instructions. It should be pretty forward, there is nothing special
about this module. 

If your Perl installation has the Time::HiRes module installed, it will
be used for improved measurements, otherwise things also work without
Time::HiRes. If you already are in the process of installing File::Temp,
you might as well install Time::HiRes (unless it already exists). Many
Linux distributions bundle these modules into their Perl installations.

Try to run "perl test.pl --help" to find out, which options are
available to you. Mine yields:

   test.pl [options]

    --contact      Use once for each job manager contact string.
    --gridftp      Use once for each gridftp server.
    --non-stop     Run in non-stop mode and assume defaults.
    --skip-globus  Skip the Globus2 tests.
    --skip-gridftp Skip the GridFTP tests (not really implemented).
    --skip-condor  Skip the Condor tests.
    --skip-java    Skip the JavaVM tests.
    --skip-chimera Skip the Chimera tests.

   Default: Run all tests (recommended), use "xxx.uchicago.edu/jobmanager"
   as contact, and "xxx.uchicago.edu" as gridftp service contact.

You can check several Globus2 jobmanager contacts, including personal
gatekeeper contacts, by repeatedly specifying the --contact clause. 

You can skip some test, which is of interest, if you re-run after some
tests failed. 

Usually, the testing is fairly interactive, and expects you to hit
enter frequently, after about a screen full of information was shown.
If you don't like this, try the non-stop mode.
