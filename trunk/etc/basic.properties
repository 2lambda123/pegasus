# TITLE "Pegasus Workflow Planner Basic Properties Property File"
# $Revision: 2865 $

#
# SECTION "INTRODUCTION"
#
# This file is the reference guide to the basic properties regarding the
# Pegasus Workflow Planner, and their respective default values. Please refer
# to the advanced properties guide to know about all the properties that
# a user can use to configure the Pegasus Workflow Planner.
# Please note that the values rely on proper capitalization, unless explicitly 
# noted otherwise.
#
# Some properties rely with their default on the value of other
# properties. As a notation, the curly braces refer to the value of the
# named property. For instance, ${pegasus.home} means that the value depends
# on the value of the pegasus.home property plus any noted additions. You
# can use this notation to refer to other properties, though the extent
# of the subsitutions are limited. Usually, you want to refer to a set
# of the standard system properties. Nesting is not allowed.
# Substitutions will only be done once.
#
# There is a priority to the order of reading and evaluating properties.
# Usually one does not need to worry about the priorities. However, it
# is good to know the details of when which property applies, and how
# one property is able to overwrite another.
#
# <ol>
# <li>Property definitions in the system property file,
# usually found in <i>${pegasus.home.sysconfdir}/properties</i>, have the
# lowest priority. These properties are expected to be set up by the submit
# host's administrator.</li>
# <li>The properties defined in the user property file
# <i>${user.home}/.pegasusrc</i> have higher priority. These can overwrite
# settings found in the system's properties. A set of sensible property
# values to set on a production system is shown below.</li>
# <li>Commandline properties have the highest priority. Each
# commandline property is introduced by a -D argument. Note that these arguments
# are parsed by the shell wrapper, and thus the -D arguments must be the first
# arguments to any command. Commandline properties are useful for debugging
# purposes.</li>
# </ol>
#
# The following example provides a sensible set of properties to be set
# by the user property file. These properties use mostly non-default
# settings. It is an example only, and will not work for you:
#
# <pre>
# pegasus.catalog.replica              File
# pegasus.catalog.replica.file         ${pegasus.home}/etc/sample.rc.data
# pegasus.catalog.transformation       Text
# pegasus.catalog.transformation.file  ${pegasus.home}/etc/sample.tc.text
# pegasus.catalog.site                 XML3
# pegasus.catalog.site.file            ${pegasus.home}/etc/sample.sites.xml3
# </pre>
#
# If you are in doubt which properties are actually visible, pegasus during the 
# planning of the workflow  dumps all properties after reading and prioritizing 
# in the submit directory in a file with the suffix properties.

# Property : pegasus.home
# Systems  : all
# Type     : directory location string
# Default  : "$PEGASUS_HOME"
#
# The property pegasus.home cannot be set in the property file. This property is 
# automatically set up by the pegasus clients internally by determining the installation
# directory of pegasus. Knowledge about this property is important for developers who 
# want to invoke PEGASUS JAVA classes without the shell wrappers. 
#
# pegasus.home		"$PEGASUS_HOME"



#
# SECTION "PROPERTY FILES AND LOCATIONS"
#
#
# This section describes the property file locations. Please refer to
# the introduction on issues about precedence of property definitions.

# Property : pegasus.properties
# Systems  : all
# Type     : file location string
# Default  : ${pegasus.home.sysconfdir}/properties
#
# The system-wide properties file will be looked for in its default
# place. It will usually reside in $PEGASUS_HOME/etc as file named
# properties.
#
# pegasus.properties	${pegasus.home}/etc/properties

# Property : pegasus.user.properties
# Systems  : all
# Type     : file location string
# Default  : ${user.home}/.pegasusrc
#
# Each user can overwrite the system-wide properties with his or her own
# definitions. The user properties rely on the system's notion of the
# user home directory, as reflected in the JRE system properties. In the
# user's home directory, a file .pegasusrc will be taken to contain user
# property definitions. Note that ${user.home} is a system property
# provided by the Java run-time environment (JRE).
#
# Older version of PEGASUS used to support a dot-chimerarc file. For a
# while, both files are supported. However, in the presence of both
# files, precedence will be granted to the dot-pegasusrc file.
#
# pegasus.user.properties	${user.home}/.pegasusrc


#
# SECTION "CATALOG PROPERTIES"
#

#
# SUBSECTION "REPLICA CATALOG"
#


# Property : pegasus.catalog.replica
# System   : Pegasus
# Since    : 2.0
# Type     : enumeration
# Value[0] : RLS
# Value[1] : LRC
# Value[2] : JDBCRC
# Value[3] : File
# Value[4] : MRC
# Default  : RLS
#
# Pegasus queries a Replica Catalog to discover the physical filenames
# (PFN) for input files specified in the DAX. Pegasus can interface
# with various types of Replica Catalogs. This property specifies
# which type of Replica Catalog to use during the planning process.
#
# <dl>
# <dt>RLS</dt>
# <dd> RLS (Replica Location Service) is a distributed replica
#      catalog, which ships with GT4. There is an index service called
#      Replica Location Index (RLI) to which 1 or more Local Replica
#      Catalog (LRC) report. Each LRC can contain all or a subset of
#      mappings. In this mode, Pegasus queries the central RLI to
#      discover in which LRC's the mappings for a LFN reside. It then
#      queries the individual LRC's for the PFN's.
#      To use RLS, the user additionally needs to set the property
#      pegasus.catalog.replica.url to specify the URL for the RLI to
#      query. 
#      Details about RLS can be found at
#      http://www.globus.org/toolkit/data/rls/  
# </dd>
#
# <dt>LRC</dt>
# <dd> If the user does not want to query the RLI, but directly a
#      single Local Replica Catalog. 
#      To use LRC, the user additionally needs to set the property
#      pegasus.catalog.replica.url to specify the URL for the LRC to
#      query. 
#      Details about RLS can be found at
#      http://www.globus.org/toolkit/data/rls/  
# </dd>
#
# <dt>JDBCRC</dt>
# <dd> In this mode, Pegasus queries a SQL based replica catalog that
#      is accessed via JDBC. The sql schema's for this catalog can be
#      found at $PEGASUS_HOME/sql directory. 
#      To use JDBCRC, the user additionally needs to set the following
#      properties
#      <ol>
#		<li>pegasus.catalog.replica.db.url</li>
#		<li>pegasus.catalog.replica.db.user</li>
#		<li>pegasus.catalog.replica.db.password</li>
#	</ol>		
# </dd>
#
# <dt>File</dt>
# <dd>In this mode, Pegasus queries a file based replica catalog. 
#     It is neither transactionally safe, nor advised to use for
#     production purposes in any way. Multiple concurrent access to
#     the File will end up clobbering the contents of the file.  The 
#     site attribute should be specified whenever possible. The attribute 
#     key for the site attribute is "pool".  
#
#     The LFN may or may not be quoted. If it contains linear
#     whitespace, quotes, backslash or an equality sign, it must be
#     quoted and escaped. Ditto for the PFN. The attribute key-value
#     pairs are separated by an equality sign  without any
#     whitespaces. The value may be in quoted. The LFN  sentiments about quoting apply.
#
#     <pre>
#     LFN PFN
#     LFN PFN a=b [..]
#     LFN PFN a="b" [..]
#     "LFN w/LWS" "PFN w/LWS" [..]
#     </pre>
#
#     To use File, the user additionally needs to specify
#     pegasus.catalog.replica.file property to specify the path to the
#     file based RC.
# </dd>
#
#
# <dt>MRC</dt>
# <dd>In this mode, Pegasus queries multiple replica catalogs to
#     discover the file locations on the grid.  To use it set
# 
#     <pre>
#     pegasus.catalog.replica MRC
#     </pre>
#
#     Each associated replica catalog can be configured via properties
#     as follows. 
#
#     The user associates a variable name referred to as [value] for
#     each of the catalogs, where [value] is any legal identifier
#     (concretely [A-Za-z][_A-Za-z0-9]*) For each associated replica
#     catalogs the user specifies the following properties. 
#
#     <pre>	
#      pegasus.catalog.replica.mrc.[value]       specifies the type of replica catalog.
#      pegasus.catalog.replica.mrc.[value].key   specifies a property name key for a
#						 particular catalog
#     </pre>	 
#
#     For example, if a user wants to query two lrc's at the same time
#     he/she can specify as follows 
#
#     <pre>	
#     pegasus.catalog.replica.mrc.lrc1 LRC
#     pegasus.catalog.replica.mrc.lrc2.url rls://sukhna
#
#     pegasus.catalog.replica.mrc.lrc2 LRC
#     pegasus.catalog.replica.mrc.lrc2.url rls://smarty
#     </pre>
# 
#
#     In the above example, lrc1, lrc2 are any valid identifier names
#     and url is the property key that needed to be specified. 
# </dd>
#
# </dl>
#
#
#
# pegasus.catalog.replica			RLS


# Property : pegasus.catalog.replica.url
# System   : Pegasus
# Since    : 2.0
# Type     : URI string
# Default  : (no default)
#
# When using the modern RLS replica catalog, the URI to the Replica
# catalog must be  provided to Pegasus to enable it to look up
# filenames. There is no  default.
#
# pegasus.catalog.replica.url			(no default)





#
# SUBSECTION "SITE CATALOG"
#


# Property : pegasus.catalog.site
# System   : Site Catalog
# Since    : 2.0
# Type     : enumeration
# Value[0] : XML3
# Value[1] : XML
# Value[2] : Text
# Default  : XML3
#
# The site catalog file is available in three major flavors: The Text and 
# and XML formats for the site catalog are deprecated.
# Users can use pegasus-sc-converter client to convert their site catalog 
# to the newer XML3 format.
# <ol>
#
# <li> The "XML" format is an XML-based file. The XML format reads site
#      catalog conforming to the old site catalog schema available at
#      http://pegasus.isi.edu/wms/docs/schemas/sc-2.0/sc-2.0.xsd 
# </li>      
#
# <li> The "XML3" format is an XML-based file. The XML format reads site
#      catalog conforming to the old site catalog schema available at
#      http://pegasus.isi.edu/wms/docs/schemas/sc-3.0/sc-3.0.xsd 
# </li>      
# 
#   <li> The "Text" format is a multiline site catalog format. It is 
#      described in the site catalog guide. It can be directly given 
#      to Pegasus starting with PEGASUS-1.4 
#   </li>	 
# </ol>
#
# pegasus.catalog.site		XML3


# Property : pegasus.catalog.site.file
# System   : Site Catalog
# Since    : 2.0
# Type     : file location string
# Default  : ${pegasus.home.sysconfdir}/sites.xml3 | ${pegasus.home.sysconfdir}/sites.xml
# See also : pegasus.catalog.site
#
# Running things on the grid requires an extensive description of the
# capabilities of each compute cluster, commonly termed "site". This
# property describes the location of the file that contains such a site
# description. As the format is currently in flow, please refer to the
# userguide and Pegasus for details which format is expected.
# The default value is dependant on the value specified for
# the property pegasus.sc . pegasus.sc denotes the type of site catalog being
# used. 
#
# pegasus.sc.file ${pegasus.home.sysconfdir}/sites.xml3 | ${pegasus.home.sysconfdir}/sites.xml

#
# SUBSECTION "TRANSFORMATION CATALOG"
#


# Property : pegasus.catalog.transformation
# System   : Transformation Catalog
# Since    : 2.0
# Type     : enumeration
# Value[0] : File
# Value[1] : Text
# Value[2] : Database
# Default  : Text
# See also : pegasus.catalog.transformation.file
#
# 
# <dl>
# <dt>Text</dt>
# <dd> In this mode, a multiline file based format is understood. The file
#     is read and cached in memory. Any modifications, as adding or
#     deleting, causes an update of the memory and hence to the file
#     underneath. All queries are done against the memory
#     representation. 
#     
#     The file sample.tc.text in the etc directory contains an example
#
#     Here is a sample textual format for transfomation catalog containing
#     one transformation on two sites
#
#     <pre>
#     tr example::keg:1.0 {
#
#	#specify profiles that apply for all the sites for the transformation
#  	#in each site entry the profile can be overriden
#       profile env "APP_HOME" "/tmp/karan"
#  	profile env "JAVA_HOME" "/bin/app"
# 
#	site isi {
#	   profile env "me" "with"
#	   profile condor "more" "test"
#	   profile env "JAVA_HOME" "/bin/java.1.6"

# </dd>
#
# <dt>File</dt>
# <dd>In this mode, a file format is understood. The file is
#     read and cached in memory. Any modifications, as adding or
#     deleting, causes an update of the memory and hence to the file
#     underneath. All queries are done against the memory
#     representation. The  TC file format uses 6 columns:
#
#     <ol>
#	<li>The resource ID is represented in the first column.</li> 
#	<li>The logical transformation uses the colonized format
#	    ns::name:vs.</li> 
#	<li>The path to the application on the system</li>
#	<li>The installation type is identified by one of the following
#	    keywords - all upper case: INSTALLED, STAGEABLE. 
#	    If not specified, or <tt>NULL</tt> is used, the type
#	    defaults to INSTALLED.</li> 
#	<li>The system is of the format ARCH::OS[:VER:GLIBC]. The
#	    following arch types are understood: "INTEL32", "INTEL64",
#	    "SPARCV7", "SPARCV9". 
#	    The following os types are understood: "LINUX", "SUNOS",
#	    "AIX". If unset or <tt>NULL</tt>, defaults to
#	    INTEL32::LINUX.</li> 	
#	<li>Profiles are written in the format
#	    NS::KEY=VALUE,KEY2=VALUE;NS2::KEY3=VALUE3 
#	    Multiple key-values for same namespace are seperated by a
#	    comma "," and multiple namespaces are seperated by a
#	    semicolon ";". If any of your profile values contains a
#	    comma  you must not use the namespace abbreviator.</li>
#    </ol>
# </dd>
#
# <dt>Database</dt>
# <dd>In this mode, the transformation catalog is kept in a relational 
#     database. Currently mysql DB and Postgre are supported. To set
#     up the the database, use the schema in
#     $PEGASUS_HOME/sql/create-my-init.sql followed by
#     $PEGASUS_HOME/sql/create-my-tc.sql .
