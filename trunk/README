Hi,

Welcome to PEGASUS. Before you try to run anything, you might want to
make sure that your environment works. We depend on a number of packages
that you need to have installed: Condor 7.4+, Java 1.6+, and optionally
Globus 4.2+, Perl 5.6+ and Python 2.4+. 

Please refer to the RELEASE_NOTES for important changes. For instance,
it is no longer necessary to set the PEGASUS_HOME environment
variable. However, in order to find all tools, you must include
Pegasus's "bin" directory in your PATH environment variable.

Please refer to the user guide for instructions on the packages and
their installation. You can find the documentation online at

  http://pegasus.isi.edu/wms/docs/3.0/index.php

and in the distributed "doc" directory.
