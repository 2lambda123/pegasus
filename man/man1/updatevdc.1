.SH NAME
updatevdc \- add new definitions to the VDDB and update existing definitions. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B updatevdc
[\-Dprop [..]] [\-d db-prefix] [\-r old] [\-\-verbose] [vdlx | vdlt [..]]
.br
.B updatevdc
[\-Dprop [..] \-V
.SH DESCRIPTION
The update command allows to add new definitions to the database, or 
update existing definitions, should it already exist. Due to the danger
of overwriting, it is recommended that you prefer to use
.B insertvdc
to add new definitions.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.B \-Dprop
The -D options allows an experienced user to override certain properties
which influence the program execution, among them the default location of
the user's properties file and the VDS home location. One may set several
CLI properties by giving this option multiple times.
.I The -D option(s) must be the first option on the command line. 
A CLI property take precedence over the properties file property 
of the same key.
.TP
.B \-d db-prefix
.PD 0
.TP
.PD 1
.B \-\-dbase db-prefix
The database prefix is currently unused.
.IP
Default is to use the VDC pointed to by the
.I vds.db.schema
property. If this property is unset, the 
.I SingleFileSchema
becomes the chosen schema, and the property
.I vds.db.schema.file.store
defaults to
.IR $VDS_HOME/var/vds.db ,
the eventual default database file.
.TP
.B \-r old
.PD 0
.TP
.PD 1
.B \-\-rejects rejects
Whenever a definition is being replace, you can collect the old versions
in a file. Please note that this file is not a VDLx file. Rather, it is
a collections of definitions, some of which may overlap, if the same 
definition is replace multiple times.
.IP
Default is to run without collecting old versions, which is more
memory efficient, and should be faster.
.TP
.B vdlt | vdlx [..]
the remaining arguments are one or more files containing either VDLt or
VDLx. The contents of each file are updating the VDC. VDLt contents are
converted to VDLX before updates using a temporary file. 
.IP
Trying to add a fully-qualified definition will result in an warning.
Processing will continue. The existing definition will be overwritten.
The old definition may be saved.

.B \-\-version

.IP
By default, few messages are printed. 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Regular and planned program terminations will result in an exit code of 0.
