.SH "DESCRIPTION"
pegasus-statistics generates statistics about the workflow run like total jobs/tasks/sub workflows ran , how many succeeded/failed etc.
It generates job instance statistics like run time, condor queue delay etc. 
It generates invocation statistics information grouped by transformation name.
It also generates job instance and invocation statistics information grouped by time and host.
