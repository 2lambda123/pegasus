.br
.B show\-properties

.SH DESCRIPTION
The property testing permits to show the effective property settings
after all property sources were parsed. This permits debugging of PEGASUS
properties, as it shows the effective properties. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.B \-Dprop
The -D options allows an experienced user to override certain properties
which influence the program execution, among them the default location of
the user's properties file and the PEGASUS home location. One may set several
CLI properties by giving this option multiple times.
