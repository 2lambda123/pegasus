.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
Each grid has its own grid handle, currently an identifier chosen by
vds\-get\-sites. Each grid hosts its own gridcat. Each gridcat contains
the configuration of all clusters associated with that grid.
.LP 
Gridcat provides in its tables \fIsites\fR and \fIsiteinfo\fR the
necessary configuration information to describe a remote cluster. The
\fBvds\-get\-sites\fR software extracts the configuration information
about the special directories $app, $data, $grid3, $tmp and $wntmp, the
addresses of gatekeeper and gridftp services, the jobmanagers available,
the number of CPUs at the site, and the \fIsite handle\fR assigned to
the site. The site handle is a unique identifier for the site. At the
moment, it has to be globally unique, too.
.LP 
\fBvds\-get\-sites\fR queries one or more remote gridcat databases. It
produces a site catalog (SC) and transformation catalog (TC) for all
valid sites found on all chosen grids. \fBvds\-get\-sites\fR permits to
query multiple gridcats, modifying information pertaining to the gridcat
in the process.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
The ordering of grid\-related options (see above) is important relative
to the \-\-grid command\-line option. The ordering of \-\-grid
command\-line options themselves is also important, if you have sites
that participate in multiple grids.
.TP 
.B  \-Dprop
The \-D option in conjunction with properties allows an experienced user
to override certain properties which influence the program execution,
among them the default location of the user's properties file and the
catalog locations. One may set several CLI properties by giving this
option multiple times.
.I The \-D option(s) must be the first option on the command line. 
Properties on the command\-line take precedence over the file\-based
properties of the same key.
.TP 
.B \-\-cutoff n
.PD 0
.TP 
.PD 1
.B \-C n
This option permits the exclusion of sites that fail to satisfy a requirement
of a minimum of number of CPUs. Only sites with
.I  n
or more CPUs are included into the site\- and transformation\-catalog.
.IP 
The default setting is 1, which includes all sites that have a CPU number
defined.
.TP
.B \-\-euryale
is just a formatting option. If specified, the storage directory of 
the gridftp server will be made identical to the working directory of
a site. Euryale itself does not care (as of this writing). If the 
.B \-\-workdir
option set a different working directory, this will then also affect
the storage directory.
.IP
Default is to always use the $data directory as storage path.
.TP 
.B \-\-debug
.PD 0
.TP 
.PD 1
.B \-d
raises the debug level. A higher debug level will increase the verbosity of
the output messages on
.IR stderr .
This is a multi\-option \- each specification will increase the debug
level by 1.
.IP 
The default debug level is 0.
.TP 
.B \-\-globus
This option triggers the deprecated generation of VDS
.I globus
universe jobmanager entries into the site catalog.
.IP 
It is off by default, and should not be used.
.TP 
.B \-\-with\-mis
This option triggers the inclusion of the OSG information\-service
jobmanagers called
.IR jobmanager\-mis .
Please note that this special jobmanager is limited to site monitoring
infrastructure. It is
.B not
meant to run regular user jobs.
.IP 
It is off by default. If you don't know what MIS is good for, you will
not need this option.
.TP 
.B \-\-tc fn
.PD 0
.TP 
.PD 1
.B \-t fn
This option permits overriding of the location of the transformation
catalog. Existing files will be backed up.
.IP 
The default is to read the location from property
.IR vds.tc.file .
If it does not exist, the default location 
.I $VDS_HOME/var/tc.data
is assumed.
.TP 
.B \-\-sc fn
.PD 0
.TP 
.PD 1
.B \-s fn
This option permits overriding the location of the site catalog.
Existing files will be backed up.
.IP 
The defualt is to read the location from property
.IR vds.sc.file .
If it does not exist, the default location
.I $VDS_HOME/var/sites.txt
or
.I $VDS_HOME/var/sites.xml 
is assumed, depending on the site catalog mode.
.TP 
.B \-\-tc\-style mode
This option sets the mode or formatting of the transformation catalog. 
Available styles include
.I old
for the deprecated 4\-column textual format,
.I new
for the 6\-column textual format, and 
.I vds
for the database\-driven format.
.IP 
Default is to read the format option from the property
.I vds.tc
or
.IR vds.tc.mode .
The Pegasus modes 
.IR single ,
.I multiple
and
.I OldFile
translate into the Euryale style
.IR old .
The recommended Pegasus mode 
.I File
translates into Euryale style 
.IR new .
The Pegasus mode
.I Database
translates into Euryale style
.IR vds .
Default style in the absence of properties is
.IR new .
.TP 
.B \-\-sc\-style mode
This option sets the mode or formatting of the site catalog. Available
styles include
.I old
for the deprecated multi\-column site catalog,
.I new
for the multi\-line site catalog, and
.I xml
for the XML site catalog.
.IP 
Default is to read the format option from the property
.I  vds.sc
or 
.IR vds.pool.mode .
The dysfunctional Pegasus modes
.I single
and
.I multiple
map to the Euryale style
.IR old ,
Pegasus mode
.I Text
maps to Euryale style
.I new 
and Pegasus mode
.I XML
maps to Euryale style 
.IR xml .
Default style in the absence of properties is
.IR xml .
.TP 
.B \-\-grid gid
This major option selects the gridcat from which to retreive the layout
of the remote sites. It is a multi\-option, and may be specified
multiple times to merge multiple grids into one site\- and
transformation catalog.
.IP 
Currently, the following 
.I gid
values are available:

    fallback   A UofC cached copy of the grid3 information
    green      The Dartmouth clusters (private)
    grid3      The Grid3 layout (deprecated)
    osg        The OSG production layout database
    osg\-itb    The OSG ITB layout database
.IP 
Default grid is 
.IR osg .
.LP 
The following set of options, if specified after a
.B \-\-grid
option, permits modifications to the presets of the grid defaults. These
options are useful to test alternative caches or to assign LRCs into
your site catalog.
.TP 
.B \-\-type drv
This option permits to specify a Perl DBI database driver module name,
which is used to connect to the remote gridcat. You can obtain a list of
modules available on your system using
.nf
\f(CB
perl \-MDBI \-e 'DBI\->installed_versions'

.B \-D db
This option permits to override the remote gridcat database name
.IR db .
The database name is like a namespace or collection of tables that is
access through one common identifier. Please note that the short option
.B \-D
must not be used as first command\-line argument. 
.IP 
The default is determined from the grid 
.I gid 
value.
.TP 
.B \-\-user dbac
.PD 0
.TP 
.PD 1
.B \-u dbac
This option permits to override the account

The default is determined from the grid 
.I gid 
value.
.TP 
.B \-\-pass dbpw
.PD 0
.TP 
.PD 1
.B \-p dbpw
This option permits to override the account's password
.I dbpw
that is used to access the remote gridcat database.

The default is determined from the grid 
.I gid 
value.
.TP 
.B \-\-rls rls
.PD 0
.TP 
.PD 1
.B \-r rls
This option permits setting of an LRC to record into the site catalog
for each site found in this grid. Note that you can record a different
LRC for each grid.
.IP 
The default is set to 
.IR rls://evitable.uchicago.edu .
The global default can be changed using the 
.B \-\-default\-rls 
option described below.
.TP 
.B \-\-version ver
This option permits setting the version of the Globus Toolkit that each
site in the grid is expected to have. Of importance are major and minor
version. The version string is either two or three period\-separated
integers.
.IP 
Default is to assume 
.I 2.4.3 
for all sites. The global default can be changed using the 
.B \-\-default\-version 
option described below.
.TP 
.B \-\-inst token
This option permits setting the installation status of the applications
in the transformation catalog for each remote site in the current grid.
Valid installation tokens include
.IR INSTALLED , 
.IR STATIC_BINARY , 
.IR DYNAMIC_BINARY ,
.IR PACMAN_PACKAGE ,
.I SOURCE
and
.IR SCRIPT .
.IP 
Default is to assume
.IR INSTALLED .
The global default can be changed using the 
.B \-\-default-inst
option described below.
.TP 
.B \-\-arch a::os
This token permits setting the architecture and operating system tokens
for each remote site in the grid, and each application. Valid
architecture tokens include
.IR INTEL32 ,
.IR INTEL64 ,
.IR AMD64 ,
.I SPARCV7 
and
.IR SPARCV9 .
Valid operating system tokens include
.IR LINUX ,
.I SOLARIS
and
.IR AIX .
.IP 
Default is to assume
.IR INTEL32::LINUX .
The global default can be changed using the 
.B \-\-default\-arch 
option described below.
.LP 
The following options permit the variables $app, $data, $grid3, $tmp and
$wntmp to be set. One additional variable $vds is set to the assumed location of
the remotely installed VDS worker tools directory. Variables are
replaced by their site\-specific values:
.TP 
.B \-\-app ttc
.PD 0
.TP 
.PD 1
.B \-a ttc
This option permits a user to override the default 
.I template transformation catalog
which is used to populate the transformation catalog for each site. The
template catalog has the same format as the 6\-columned textual
transformation catalog
.B minus the site column. 
The template TC usually mentions the variables $app .. $wntmp, which are
replaced, as the catalog contents are instantiated for each site. The
default templates are remove in the presence of a user\-specified
template, unless option
.B \-\-keep
is specified.
.IP 
Default is to map the basic example transformations from the test
directory onto each site. Please refer to the output of the
.B \-\-help
option for an example of the file's layout. 
.TP 
.B \-\-keep
If this option is specified in conjunction with a user template
transformation catalog, the example applications will be retained, and
become part of the generated transformation catalog.
.TP 
.B \-\-workdir rdir
.PD 0
.TP 
.PD 1
.B \-w rdir
This option permits specifying the remote working directory. It is
highly recommended to override the default, and to use one of the
template variables in the specification, e.g. '$data/ourvo'. Please note
that you will have to protect the dollar sign from the shell, e.g. using
single quotes around your values.
.IP 
Default is to use the remote shared 
.I $tmp 
as working directory.
.TP 
.B \-\-vds rdir
.PD 0
.TP 
.PD 1
.B \-v rdir
This option sets the variable $vds to a different value. It specifies
the location where on the remote site the VDS worker tools are
installed. For sites installed with VDS < 1.3.5 you need to override the
default with '$grid3/vds/linux/bin'. Please note that you will have to
protect the dollar sign from the shell, e.g. using single quotes around
your values.
.IP 
Default is to use 
.I '$grid3/vds/bin' 
as VDS worker tools directory.
.TP 
.B \-\-kick ks
.PD 0
.TP 
.PD 1
.B \-k ks
This option permits specifying an alternate location for the remote
kickstart. This is useful, if you are using a fresher version of
kickstart than the site administrator installed as part of the VDS
worker tools package.
.IP 
Default is to use the VDS worker tools 
.IR $vds/kickstart .
.TP
.B \-\-default\-rls rls
This option overwrites the initial default to chose as RLS server for
all grids. It will also affect which RLS server is chosen for the
special site
.IR local .
Individual grids can overwrite their RLS using the 
.B \-\-rls 
option after the 
.B \-\-grid 
option.
.TP
.B \-\-default\-version m.m.p
This option overwrites the initial default version of the Globus Toolkit
for all grids. It will also affect which GT version is chosen for the
special site
.IR local .
Individual grids can overwrite their GT version using the 
.B \-\-version
option after the 
.B \-\-grid 
option.
.TP
.B \-\-default\-inst inst
This option overwrites the initial default installation status to assume
for transformations in all grids. It will also affect the installation
status of application on the special site
.IR local .
Individual grids can overwrite their installation status using the 
.B \-\-inst
option after the 
.B \-\-grid 
option. For valid values to this option, please refer to the 
.B \-\-inst
option above.
.TP
.B \-\-default\-arch a::os
This option overwrites the initial default architecture to assume for
all grids. It will also affect, which architecture is chosen for the
special site
.IR local .
Individual grids can overwrite their architecture settings using the 
.B \-\-rls 
option after the 
.B \-\-grid 
option. For valid values to this option, please refer to the 
.B \-\-inst
option above.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP 
This first example queries just for one grid. It is always a good idea
to explicitely specify the grid you are querying. The example uses
default locations for the site catalog (SC) and transformation catalog
(TC). \fBWarning:\fR The default location is derived from settings in
your VDS properties file. The example supplies its own template
transformation catalog and chooses not to keep the example
transformations:
.nf 
\f(CB
$ vds\-get\-sites \-\-grid osg\-itb \-\-app my.ttc 
# local hostname "griodine.uchicago.edu"
# reading transformation mappings from /dev/null
# assembling information for grid "osg\-itb".
...
# adding myself as local site
# dumping /home/voeckler/work/pool.gt2...
# dumping /home/voeckler/vds/contrib/Euryale/Grid3/tc.new.data...
\fP
.fi 
.LP 
Again, please note that the user properties were set up to some
non\-standard locations, and the files there were consequently
overwritten.
.LP 
A more demanding example mixes sites from two grids, assigning a
different RLS default. The output is captured in separate SC and TC
files. Only sites with 10 or more CPUs are included. Please note that
the RLS override will also affect the local site: 
.nf 
\f(CB
$ vds\-get\-sites \-\-default\-rls rls://griodine.uchicago.edu \-\-cutoff 10 \\
 \-\-sc\-style xml \-\-sc sites.xml \-\-tc\-style new \-\-tc tc.data \\
 \-\-grid osg \-\-grid osg\-itb
...
\fP
.fi 
.LP 
In my case, the example included a couple of warnings due to the fact
that one site handle was part of both gridcats. The precedence is that
the later found information overwrites any previous information. Thus,
the ordering of the \-\-grid options is important.
.LP
Note, it is a bad idea to mix grids OSG and OSG-ITB.
