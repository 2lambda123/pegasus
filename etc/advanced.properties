# TITLE "PROPERTIES"
#
# This is the reference guide to all properties regarding the
# Pegasus Workflow Planner, and their respective default values. Please refer
# to the user guide for a discussion when and which properties to use to
# configure various components. Please note that the values rely on
# proper capitalization, unless explicitly noted otherwise.
#
# Some properties rely with their default on the value of other
# properties. As a notation, the curly braces refer to the value of the
# named property. For instance, ${pegasus.home} means that the value depends
# on the value of the pegasus.home property plus any noted additions. You
# can use this notation to refer to other properties, though the extent
# of the subsitutions are limited. Usually, you want to refer to a set
# of the standard system properties. Nesting is not allowed.
# Substitutions will only be done once.
#
#
# There is a priority to the order of reading and evaluating properties.
# Usually one does not need to worry about the priorities. However, it
# is good to know the details of when which property applies, and how
# one property is able to overwrite another. The following is a mutually exclusive
# list ( highest priority first ) of property file locations.  
#
# <orderedlist>
# <listitem>--conf option to the tools. Almost all of the clients that use properties 
#  have a --conf option to specify the property file to pick up. 
# </listitem>
# <listitem> submit-dir/pegasus.xxxxxxx.properties file. All tools that work on the 
# submit directory ( i.e after pegasus has planned a workflow) pick up the 
# pegasus.xxxxx.properties file from the submit directory. The location for the 
# pegasus.xxxxxxx.propertiesis picked up from the braindump file.
# </listitem>
# <listitem>The properties defined in the user property file
# <emphasis>${user.home}/.pegasusrc</emphasis> have lowest priority. 
# </listitem>
# </orderedlist>
# 
# Commandline properties have the highest priority. These override any property loaded 
# from a property file. Each  commandline property is introduced by a -D argument. 
# Note that these arguments  are parsed by the shell wrapper, and thus the -D arguments 
# must be the first arguments to any command. Commandline properties are useful for debugging
# purposes.
#
# From Pegasus 3.1 release onwards, support has been dropped for the following
# properties that were used to signify the location of the properties file
#
# <itemizedlist>
#  <listitem>pegasus.properties</listitem>
#  <listitem>pegasus.user.properties</listitem>
# </itemizedlist>
#
# The following example provides a sensible set of properties to be set
# by the user property file. These properties use mostly non-default
# settings. It is an example only, and will not work for you:
#
# <screen>
# pegasus.catalog.replica              File
# pegasus.catalog.replica.file         ${pegasus.home}/etc/sample.rc.data
# pegasus.catalog.transformation       Text
# pegasus.catalog.transformation.file  ${pegasus.home}/etc/sample.tc.text
# pegasus.catalog.site                 XML3
# pegasus.catalog.site.file            ${pegasus.home}/etc/sample.sites.xml3
# </screen>
#
# If you are in doubt which properties are actually visible, pegasus during the 
# planning of the workflow  dumps all properties after reading and prioritizing 
# in the submit directory in a file with the suffix properties.

# Property : pegasus.home
# Systems  : all
# Type     : directory location string
# Default  : "$PEGASUS_HOME"
#
# The property pegasus.home cannot be set in the property file. This property is 
# automatically set up by the pegasus clients internally by determining the installation
# directory of pegasus. Knowledge about this property is important for developers who 
# want to invoke PEGASUS JAVA classes without the shell wrappers. 
#
# pegasus.home		"$PEGASUS_HOME"




# 
# SECTION "LOCAL DIRECTORIES"
#
# This section describes the GNU directory structure conventions. GNU
# distinguishes between architecture independent and thus sharable
# directories, and directories with data specific to a platform, and
# thus often local. It also distinguishes between frequently modified
# data and rarely changing data. These two axis form a space of four
# distinct directories. 

# Property : pegasus.home.datadir
# Systems  : all
# Type     : directory location string
# Default  : ${pegasus.home}/share
#
# The datadir directory contains broadly visiable and possilby exported
# configuration files that rarely change. This directory is currently
# unused.
#
# pegasus.home.datadir	${pegasus.home}/share

# Property : pegasus.home.sysconfdir
# Systems  : all
# Type     : directory location string
# Default  : ${pegasus.home}/etc
#
# The system configuration directory contains configuration files that
# are specific to the machine or installation, and that rarely change.
# This is the directory where the XML schema definition copies are
# stored, and where the base pool configuration file is stored.
#
# pegasus.home.sysconfdir	${pegasus.home}/etc

# Property : pegasus.home.sharedstatedir
# Systems  : all
# Type     : directory location string
# Default  : ${pegasus.home}/com
#
# Frequently changing files that are broadly visible are stored in the
# shared state directory. This is currently unused.
#
# pegasus.home.sharedstatedir	${pegasus.home}/com

# Property : pegasus.home.localstatedir
# Systems  : all
# Type     : directory location string
# Default  : ${pegasus.home}/var
#
# Frequently changing files that are specific to a machine and/or
# installation are stored in the local state directory. This directory
# is being used for the textual transformation catalog, 
# and the file-based replica catalog.
#
# pegasus.home.localstatedir	${pegasus.home}/var

# Property : pegasus.dir.submit.logs
# System   : Pegasus
# Since	   : 2.4
# Type     : directory location string
# Default  : false
#
# By default, Pegasus points the condor logs for the workflow to
#  /tmp directory. This is done to ensure that the logs are created 
# in a local directory even though the submit directory maybe on NFS. 
# In the submit directory the symbolic link to the appropriate log file
# in the /tmp exists. 
#
# However, since /tmp is automatically purged in most cases, users
# may want to preserve their condor logs in a directory on the
# local filesystem other than /tmp  
#
#
# pegasus.dir.submit.logs		(no default)

#
# SECTION "SITE DIRECTORIES"
#
# The site directory properties modify the behavior of remotely run jobs. 
# In rare occasions, it may also pertain to locally run compute jobs. 

# Property : pegasus.dir.useTimestamp
# System   : Pegasus
# Since	   : 2.1
# Type     : Boolean
# Default  : false
#
# While creating the submit directory, Pegasus employs a run numbering
# scheme. Users can use this property to use a timestamp based
# numbering scheme instead of the runxxxx scheme.
#
# pegasus.dir.useTimestamp		false



# Property : pegasus.dir.exec
# System   : Pegasus
# Since    : 2.0
# Type     : remote directory location string
# Default  : (no default)
#
# This property modifies the remote location work directory in which all
# your jobs will run. If the path is relative then it is appended to the
# work directory (associated with the site), as specified in the site
# catalog.  If the path is  absolute then it overrides the work directory
# specified in the site catalog. 
#
# pegasus.dir.exec			(no default)

# Property : pegasus.dir.storage
# System   : Pegasus
# Since	   : 2.0
# Type     : remote directory location string
# Default  : (no default)
#
# This property modifies the remote storage location on various pools.
# If the path is relative then it is appended to the storage mount point
# specified in the pool.config file. If the path is absolute then it
# overrides the storage mount point specified in the pool config file.
#
# pegasus.dir.storage		(no default)

# Property : pegasus.dir.storage.deep
# System   : Pegasus
# Since	   : 2.1
# Type     : Boolean
# Default  : false
# See Also : pegasus.dir.storage
# See Also : pegasus.dir.useTimestamp
# 
# This property results in the creation of a deep directory structure
# on the output site, while populating the results. The base directory
# on the remote end is determined from the site catalog and the
# property pegasus.dir.storage.
# 
# To this base directory, the relative submit directory structure 
# ( $user/$vogroup/$label/runxxxx ) is appended.
#
# $storage = $base + $relative_submit_directory
#
# Depending on the number of files being staged to the remote site a
# Hashed File Structure is created that ensures that only 256 files
# reside in one directory.
#
# To create this directory structure on the storage site, Pegasus
# relies on the directory creation feature of the Grid FTP server,
# which appeared in globus 4.0.x
#
# pegasus.dir.storage.true		false



# Property : pegasus.dir.create.strategy
# System   : Pegasus
# Since	   : 2.2
# Type     : enumeration
# Value[0] : HourGlass
# Value[1] : Tentacles
# Default  : Tentacles
#
# If the <screen>--randomdir</screen> option is given to the Planner at
# runtime, the Pegasus planner adds nodes that create the random
# directories at the remote pool sites, before any jobs are 
# actually run. The two modes determine the placement of these
# nodes and their dependencies to the rest of the graph.
#
# <variablelist>
# <varlistentry><term>HourGlass</term>
# <listitem>
#   It adds a make directory node at the top level of the graph, and all
#   these concat to a single dummy job before branching out to the root
#   nodes of the original/ concrete dag so far. So we introduce a
#   classic X shape at the top of the graph. Hence the name HourGlass.
# </listitem></varlistentry>
# <varlistentry><term>Tentacles</term>
# <listitem>
#   This option places the jobs creating directories at the top of the
#   graph. However instead of constricting it to an hour glass shape,
#   this mode links the top node to all the relevant nodes for which the
#   create dir job is necessary. It looks as if the node spreads its
#   tentacleas all around. This puts more load on the DAGMan because of
#   the added dependencies but removes the restriction of the plan
#   progressing only when all the create directory jobs have progressed
#   on the remote pools, as is the case in the HourGlass model.
# </listitem></varlistentry>
# </variablelist>
#
# pegasus.dir.create.strategy		Tentacles

# Property : pegasus.dir.create.impl
# System   : Pegasus
# Since    : 2.2
# Type     : enumeration
# Value[0] : DefaultImplementation
# Value[1] : S3
# Default  : DefaultImpelmentation
#
# This property is used to select the executable that is used to
# create the working directory on the compute sites.
#  
#
# <variablelist>
# <varlistentry><term>DefaultImplementation</term>
# <listitem>
#    The default executable that is used to create a directory is the
#    dirmanager executable shipped with Pegasus. It is found at
#    $PEGASUS_HOME/bin/dirmanager in the pegasus distribution.
#    An entry for transformation pegasus::dirmanager needs
#    to exist in the Transformation Catalog or the PEGASUS_HOME
#    environment variable should be specified in the site catalog for
#    the sites for this mode to work.
# </listitem></varlistentry>
# <varlistentry><term>S3</term>
# <listitem>
#   This option is used to create buckets in S3 instead of a
#   directory. This should be set when running workflows on Amazon
#   EC2. This implementation relies on s3cmd command line client to
#   create the bucket. An entry for transformation amazon::s3cmd needs
#   to exist in the Transformation Catalog for this to work.

#
# This file is a copy of the XML schema that describes abstract DAG

# Default  : 1000
#
# The rc-client takes in an input file containing the mappings upon
# which to work. This property determines, the number of lines that
# are read in at a time, and worked upon at together. This allows the
# various operations like insert, delete happen in bulk if the

# Since    : 2.0
# Type     : comma separated list of LRC urls
# Default  : (no default)
# See also : pegasus.catalog.replica.lrc.restrict
#
# Certain users may like to skip some LRCs while querying for the physical
# locations of a file. If some LRCs need to be skipped from those found in the
# rli then use this property. You can define either the full URL or partial
# domain names that need to be skipped. E.g. If a user wants 
# rls://smarty.isi.edu and all LRCs on usc.edu to be skipped then the 
# property will be set as pegasus.rls.lrc.ignore=rls://smarty.isi.edu,usc.edu

# Property : pegasus.catalog.replica.lrc.restrict
# System   : Replica Catalog - RLS
# Since    : 1.3.9
# Type     : comma separated list of LRC urls
# Default  : (no default)
# See also : pegasus.catalog.replica.lrc.ignore
#
# This property applies a tighter restriction on the results returned
# from the LRCs specified. Only those PFNs are returned that have a
# pool attribute associated with them. The property "pegasus.rc.lrc.ignore"
# has a higher priority than "pegasus.rc.lrc.restrict". For example, in case
# a LRC is specified in both properties, the LRC would be ignored (i.e.
# not queried at all instead of applying a tighter restriction on the
# results returned).
#
# pegasus.catalog.replica.lrc.restrict			(no default)

# Property : pegasus.catalog.replica.lrc.site.[site-name]
# System   : Replica Catalog - RLS
# Since    : 2.3.0
# Type     : LRC url
# Default  : (no default)
# 
#
# This property allows for the LRC url to be associated with site 
# handles. Usually, a pool attribute is required to be associated with 
# the PFN for Pegasus to figure out the site on which PFN resides. 
# However, in the case where an LRC is responsible for only 
# a single site's mappings, Pegasus can safely associate LRC url
# with the site. This association can be used to determine the pool 
# attribute for all  mappings returned from the LRC, if the mapping 
# does not have a pool attribute associated with it. 
#
# The site_name in the property should be replaced by the name of 
# the site. For example
# <screen>
#  pegasus.catalog.replica.lrc.site.isi  rls://lrc.isi.edu
# </screen>
# tells Pegasus that all PFNs returned from LRC rls://lrc.isi.edu
# are associated with site isi.
#
# The [site_name] should be the same as the site handle specified in 
# the site catalog.

# Type     : Boolean
# Value[0] : false
# Value[1] : true
# Default  : false
# See also : pegasus.catalog.replica
# 
# This property determines whether to treat the cache file specified
# as a supplemental replica catalog or not. User can specify on the
# command line to pegasus-plan a comma separated list of cache files using
# the --cache option. By default, the LFN->PFN mappings contained in
# the cache file are treated as cache, i.e if an entry is found in a
# cache file the replica catalog is not queried. This results in only
# the entry specified in the cache file to be available for replica
# selection. 
#
# Setting this property to true, results in the cache files to be
# treated as supplemental replica catalogs. This results in the
# mappings found in the replica catalog (as specified by
# pegasus.catalog.replica) to be  merged with the ones found in the
# cache files. Thus, mappings for  a particular LFN found in both the
# cache and the replica catalog are available for replica selection.

# SECTION "INTERFACE TO Condor and Condor DAGMan"
#
#
# The Condor DAGMan facility is usually activate using the
# condor_submit_dag command. However, many shapes of workflows have the
# ability to either overburden the submit host, or overflow remote
# gatekeeper hosts. While DAGMan provides throttles, unfortunately these
# can only be supplied on the command-line. Thus,PEGASUS provides a
# versatile wrapper to invoke DAGMan, called pegasus-submit-dag. It can be
# configured from the command-line, from user- and system properties,
# and by defaults.

# Property : pegasus.condor.logs.symlink
# System   : Condor
# Type     : Boolean
# Default  : true
# Since    : 3.0
#
# By default pegasus has the Condor common log [dagname]-0.log in the submit
# file as a symlink to a location in /tmp . This is to ensure that condor
# common log does not get written to a shared filesystem. If the user knows
# for sure that the workflow submit directory is not on the shared filesystem,
# then they can opt to turn of the symlinking of condor common log file by
# setting this property to false.

#
# This property determines whether to apply the new Condor quoting
# rules for quoting the argument string. The new argument quoting
# rules appeared in Condor 6.7.xx series. We have verified it for
# 6.7.19 version. If you are using an old condor at the submit host,

#
# The pegasus-submit-dag wrapper processes properties to set DAGMan
# commandline arguments. The argument sets the e-mail notification for
# DAGMan itself. This information will be used within the Condor submit
# description file for DAGMan. This file is produced by the the

# Document : http://vtcpc.isi.edu/pegasus/index.php/ChangeLog\#Support_for_DAGMan_node_categories
# 
# DAGMan now allows for the nodes in the DAG to be grouped in
# category. The tuning parameters like maxjobs then can be applied per
# category instead of being applied to the whole workflow. To use this
# facility users need to associate the dagman profile key named
# category with their jobs.  The value of the key is the category to
# which the job belongs to. 
#
# You can then use this property to specify the value for a

# Property : pegasus.monitord.output
# System   : Pegasus-monitord
# Type     : String
# Since    : 3.0.2
# See Also : pegasus.monitord.events
#
# This property specifies the destination for generated log events in
# pegasus-monitord. By default, events are stored in a sqlite database
# in the workflow directory, which will be created with the workflow's
# name, and a ".stampede.db" extension. Users can specify an
# alternative database by using a SQLAlchemy connection
# string. Details are available at:
# <screen>
# http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/05/reference/dialects/index.html
# </screen>
# It is important to note that users will need to have the appropriate
# db interface library installed. Which is to say, SQLAlchemy is a
# wrapper around the mysql interface library (for instance), it does
# not provide a MySQL driver itself.  The Pegasus distribution
# includes both SQLAlchemy and the SQLite Python driver. 
# As a final note, it is important to mention that unlike when using
# SQLite databases, using SQLAlchemy with other database servers,
# e.g. MySQL or Postgres , the target database needs to exist.
# Users can also specify a file name using this property in order to
# create a file with the log events.

# notification scripts, letting them run indefinitely. If some
# notification scripts missbehave, this has the potential problem of
# starving pegasus-monitord's notification slots (see the

#     compute/worker node using pegasus-transfer. The output data for each job is 
#     similarly shipped back to the submit host from the compute/worker node.
#     The protocols supported are at this time SRM, GridFTP, iRods, S3.
#     This setup is particularly helpful when running workflows on OSG where

#     sites have large amounts of data storage exposed that can be used to place
#     data during a workflow run. This setup is also helpful when running workflows
#     in the cloud environment where setting up a shared filesystem across the VM's may be

# Pegasus now supports transfer of statically linked executables as
# part of the concrete workflow. At present, there is only support for
# staging of executables referred to by the compute jobs specified in
# the DAX file.
# Pegasus determines the source locations of the binaries from the
# transformation catalog, where it searches for entries of type
# STATIC_BINARY for a particular architecture type. The PFN for these
# entries should refer to a globus-url-copy valid and accessible
# remote URL.
# For transfer of executables, Pegasus constructs a soft state map
# that resides  on top of the transformation catalog, that helps in
# determining the locations from where an executable can be staged to
# the remote site.
#
# This property determines, how that map is created.
# <variablelist>
# <varlistentry><term>All</term>
# <listitem>In this mode, all sources with entries of type STATIC_BINARY

# </listitem></varlistentry>
# <varlistentry><term>Installed</term>
# <listitem>In this mode, only entries that are of type INSTALLED
