The annotational VDC is the new default VDC. If you have a previous VDC
before version 1.3.6, please use the -old.sql files for it.

The "real" Documentation
------------------------

Please refer to the Database Admin Guide for the in-depth documentation.

Filenames
---------

The schema-related filenames follow a pattern:

	<work>-<db>-<schema>.sql

where

  <work>	is either "create" to instantiate a schema
		or "delete" to drop the schema and all data.
		The "update" is used to migrate an existing
		database from an old schema to a new schema.

  <db>		is the database backend for which this flavor of
		DDL instruction is being issued:

	my	MySQL 4.0.*
	pg	PostGreSQL 7.4.* (we do NOT recommend Pg 8.0.*)
	sl      SQLite 2.* (not supported)

  <schema>	is a short for a database schema description.
		Currently we support:

	init	schema metadata upon which the rest depends
	tc	org.griphyn.common.catalog.transformation.Database
	rc      JDBC generic (uses autoinc) implementation
	wf      workflow manager and site information

The schemas marked with a "+" are mutually exclusive. The special files:

	<work>-<db>.sql

creates, deletes, or updates a recommended set of schemas
(init,anno,ptc,tc,rc,wf) for Annotations. Alternatively, the special
files:

	<work>-<db>-old.sql

creates, deletes, or updates a recommended set of schemas
(init,chunk,ptc,tc,rc,wf) for chunks.
