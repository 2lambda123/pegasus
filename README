Hi,
Welcome to PEGASUS. Before you try to run anything, you might want to
make sure that your environment works. We depend on a number of packages
that you need to have installed: Globus 4+, Condor 6.8+ and Java 1.5+

Please refer to the RELEASE_NOTES for last-minute important changes.
You must set your PEGASUS_HOME environment variable to the directory where
the PEGASUS was installed.

Please refer to the user guide (in doc directory) for instructions on
the packages and their installation. To check your submit host, make
sure:

o you set up your Globus client software, 
o you know some Globus lingo like the difference between a gatekeeper
  and a jobmanager.
o your personal certificate proxy is active, valid and accepted
  on the execution sites,
o you actually have at least one execution site,
o (personal) Condor-G is up and running,
o Java is available in recommended version 1.5.*, and
o you set up your PEGASUS environment by sourcing the setup
  (see below) script for your shell.
