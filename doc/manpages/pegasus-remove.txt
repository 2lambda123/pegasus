Name
----
pegasus-remove - removes a workflow that has been planned and submitted 
using pegasus-plan and pegasus-run


Synopsis
--------
[verse]
pegasus-remove [*-d* 'dagid'] [*-v*] ['rundir']


Description
-----------
The pegasus-remove command remove a submitted/running workflow that has 
been planned and submitted using *pegasus-plan* and *pegasus-run*. The 
command can be invoked either in the planned directory with no options 
and arguments or just the full path to the run directory.


Options
-------
By default pegasus-remove does not require any options or arguments if 
invoked from within the planned workflow directory. If running the 
command outside the workflow directory then a full path to the workflow 
directory needs to be specified or the 'dagid' of the workflow to be 
removed.

*pegasus-remove* takes the following options:

*-d* 'dagid'::
*--dagid* 'dagid'::
The workflow dagid to remove

*-v*::
*--verbose*::
Raises debug level. Each invocation increase the level by 1.

'rundir'::
Is the full qualified path to the base directory containing the planned 
workflow DAG and submit files. This is optional if pegasus-remove 
command is invoked from within the run directory.


Return Value
------------
If the workflow is removed successfully pegasus-remove returns with 
an exit code of 0. However, in case of error, a non-zero exit code 
indicates problems. An error message clearly marks the cause.


Files
-----
The following files are opened:

*braindump*::
This file is located in the rundir. pegasus-remove uses this file 
to find out paths to several other files.


Environment Variables
---------------------
*PATH*::
The path variable is used to locate binary for *condor_rm*.
