pegasus-dax-validator(1)
========================
:doctype: manpage


Name
----
pegasus-dax-validator - determines if a given DAX file is valid. 


Synopsis
--------
[verse]
*pegasus-dax-validator* 'daxfile' ['verbose']


Description
-----------
The *pegasus-dax-validator* is a simple application that determines, if 
a given DAX file is valid XML. For this, it parses the file with as many 
XML validity checks that the Apache Xerces XML parser framework supports. 


Options
-------
'daxfile'::
The location of the file containing the DAX.


'verbose'::
If any kind of second argument was specified, not limited to the string 
'verbose', the verbose output mode is switched on. 


Return Value
------------
If the DAX was parsed successfully, or only 'warning's were issued, the
exit code is 0. Any 'error' or 'fatal error' will result in an exit code
of 1. 

Additionally, a summary statistics with counts of warnings, errors, and
fatal errors will be displayed.


Example
-------
The following shows the parsing of a DAX file that uses the wrong kind 
of value for certain enumerations. The output shows the errors with the
respective line number and column number of the input DAX file, so that
one can find and fix them more easily. (The lines in the example were
broken to fit the manpage format.)
