Name
----
pegasus-submitdir - Manage a workflow submit directory.

Synopsis
--------
[verse]
*pegasus-submitdir* 'COMMAND' [options] 'SUBMITDIR'

Description
-----------
*pegasus-submitdir* is used to manage submit directories generated by the
Pegasus planner.

The *archive* command significantly reduces the size of workflow submit
directories by compressing the data in a way such that it remains accessible
to tools such as pegasus-statistics, pegasus-plots, and pegasus-analyzer.
It creates a gzipped tar archive of the submit files and logs that excludes
files such as the stampede database, braindump file, and monitord logs, which
are used by pegasus reporting tools.

The *extract* command reverses the effect of the *archive* command.

Commands
--------
*archive* SUBMITDIR::
    Compresses a workflow submit directory in a way that allows
    pegasus-dashboard, pegasus-statistics, pegasus-plots, and
    pegasus-analyzer to keep working.

*extract* SUBMITDIR::
    Uncompresses a previously archived submit directory. This option returns
    the submit directory to the state it was before *pegasus-submitdir archive*
    was applied to it.

Global Options
--------------
*-h*::
*--help*::
Prints a usage summary with all the available command-line options.
