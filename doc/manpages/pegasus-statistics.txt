Description
-----------
pegasus-statistics generates statistics about the workflow run like total 
jobs/tasks/sub workflows ran , how many succeeded/failed etc. It generates 
job instance statistics like run time, condor queue delay etc. It generates 
invocation statistics information grouped by transformation name. It also 
generates job instance and invocation statistics information grouped by 
time and host. 


Options
-------
*-h*::
*--help*::
Prints a usage summary with all the available command-line options.

*-o* 'dir'::
*--output*  'dir'::
Writes the output to the given directory. 

*-c* 'propfile'::
*--conf*  'propfile'::
The properties file to use. This option overrides all other property files.

*-s* 'level'::
*--statistics-level* 'level'::
Specifies the statistics information to generate. Valid levels are: *all*, 
*summary*, *wf_stats*, *jb_stats*, *tf_stats*, and *ti_stats*. Default is 
*summary*. The output generated by pegasus-statistics is based on the the 
'level' set:

- *all*: generates all the statistics information.

- *summary*: generates the workflow statistics summary. In the case of a
hierarchical workflow the summary is across all sub workflows.

- *wf_stats*: generates the workflow statistics information of each 
individual workflow. In case of a hierarchical workflow the workflow 
statistics are created for each sub workflow.

- *jb_stats*: generates the job statistics information of each individual 
workflow. In case of hierarchical workflow the job statistics is created 
for each sub workflows.

- *tf_stats*: generates the invocation statistics information of each 
individual workflow grouped by transformation name .In case of hierarchical 
workflow the transformation statistics is created for each sub workflows.

- *ti_stats*: generates the job instance and invocation statistics like total 
count and runtime grouped by time and host.

*-t* 'filter'::
*--time-filter* 'filter'::
Specifies the time filter to group the time statistics. Valid 'filter' values 
are: *month*, *week*, *day*, *hour*. Default is *day*.

*-i*::
*--ignore-db-inconsistency*::
Turn off the the check for database consistency.
 
*-v*::
*--verbose*::
Increases the log level.  If omitted, the default level will be set to 
WARNING.  When this option is given, the log level is changed to INFO. 
If this option is repeated, the log level will be changed to DEBUG.

*-q*::
*--quiet*::
Decreases the log level.  If omitted, the default level will be set to 
WARNING.  When this option is given, the log level is changed to ERROR.


Example
-------
Runs pegasus-statistics and writes the output to the given directory:
----------
$ pegasus-statistics  -o /scratch/statistics /scratch/grid-setup/run0001
