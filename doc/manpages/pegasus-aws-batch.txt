Description
-----------
*pegasus-aws-batch* a client to run tasks on Amazon AWS Batch. Also
allows you to create and delete entities such as job definition,
compute environment and job queue required by AWS Batch Service.

The tool also allows you to upload files from your local machine to
the S3 bucket specified on the command line or the properties. 


Options
-------

*-h*::
*--help*::
Show help message for subcommand and exit

*--account*='AWS region'::
the AWS region in which the S3 bucket and other batch entitites
required by AWS batch exist. Can also be specified in the properites

. Don't run any jobs.  

*-p* 'prefix'::
*--prefix*='prefix'::
The prefix to use for naming the batch entities created. Default
suffixes -job-definition, -compute-environment, -job-queue, -bucket
are added depending on the batch entity being created.

*-j* 'jsonfile or arn or job-definition name'::
*--job-definition* 'jsonfile or arn or job-definition name'::
 the json file containing job definition specification to register for
