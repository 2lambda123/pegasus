==================
:doctype: manpage


Name
----
pegasus-archive - Compresses a workflow submit directory in a way that
allows pegasus-dashboard, pegasus-statistics, pegasus-plots, and
pegasus-analyzer to keep working.


Synopsis
--------
[verse]
*pegasus-archive* [*-h*][*-v*][*-x*] 'submit_dir'


Description
-----------
*pegasus-archive* significantly reduces the size of workflow submit
directories by compressing the data in a way such that it remains accessible
to tools such as pegasus-statistics, pegasus-plots, and pegasus-analyzer.
It creates a .tar.gz archive of the submit files and logs that excludes
files such as the stampede database, braindump file, and monitord logs, which
are used by pegasus reporting tools.

Options
-------

*-h*::
*--help*::
Prints a usage summary with all the available command-line options.

*-v*::
*--verbose*::
Print detailed messages about the archiving process.

*-x*::
*--extract*::
Un-archive a previously archived submit directory. This option returns the
submit directory to the state it was before *pegasus-archive* was applied to
it.
