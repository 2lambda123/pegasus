:doctype: manpage


Name
----
pegasus-dashboard - Starts the Pegasus monitoring dashboard.


Synopsis
--------
[verse]
*pegasus-dashboard* [*--help*|*-h*] [*--host*|*-n*] [*--port*|*-p*]
                 [*--masterdburl*|*-m* 'database url']


Description
-----------

*pegasus-dashboard* is a command-line utility to start the 
*Pegasus* monitoring dashboard. The dashboard allows users to monitor 
status of workflows using a browser. The workflow status information 
is retrieved from a STAMPEDE database. The STAMPEDE database is populated 
in a *SQLite*, or *MySQL* database as per your configuration, when a 
workflow is planned or run


Options
-------

*-h*::
*--help*::
Prints a usage summary with all the available command-line options.

*-n*::
*--host*::
Only print the the output and error filenames instead of their contents.

*-p*::
*--port*::
Get jobs' output and error filenames from the job's submit file.

*-m*::
*--masterdburl*::
The Pegasus dashboard uses a user specific master database, to identify which 
workflows have been run. By default this database is created in the .pegasus 
directory in the user's home directory, when a workflow is planned. The -m option 
allows the user to specify a custom database. 

Note: The dashboard can only track workflows, which are listed in the master database.


Environment Variables
---------------------
*pegasus-dashboard* does not require that any environmental variables be set. 
It locates its required Python modules based on its own location, and 
therefore should not be moved outside of Pegasus' bin directory.


Example
-------

----------------
$ pegasus-dashboard 
$ pegasus-dashboard -n 127.0.0.1 -p 8080
$ pegasus-dashboard -n localhost -p 80
$ pegasus-dashboard -m sqlite:///lfs/scratch//workflow.db
