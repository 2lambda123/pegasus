pegasus-keg - kanonical executable for grids


Synopsis
--------
[verse]
*pegasus-keg* [-a appname] [-t interval |-T interval] [-l logname]
            [-P prefix] [-o fn [..]] [-i fn [..]] [-G sz] 
            [-C] [-e env [..]] [-p parm [..]]


Description
-----------

The kanonical executable is a stand-in for regular binaries in a DAG -
but not for their arguments. It allows to trace the shape of the
execution of a DAG, and thus is an aid to debugging DAG related issues.

Key feature of *pegasus-keg* is that it can copy any number of input
files, including the _generator_ case, to any number of output files,
including the _datasink_ case. In addition, it protocols the IPv4 and
hostname of the host it ran upon, the current timestamp, and the run
time from start til the point of logging the information, the current
working directory and some information on the system environment.
*pegasus-keg* will also report all input files, the current output files
and any requested string and environment value.


Arguments
---------

The *-e*, *-i*, *-o* and *-p* arguments allow lists with arbitrary
number of arguments. These options may also occur repeatedly on the
command line. The file options may be provided with the special filename
- to indicate _stdout_ in append mode for writing, or _stdin_ for
reading. The *-a*, *-l* , *-P* , *-T* and *-t* arguments should only
occur a single time with a single argument.

If *pegasus-keg*
is called without any arguments, it will display its usage and exit with
success.

*-a appname*::
This option allows *pegasus-keg* to display a different name as its
applications. This mode of operation is useful in make-believe mode. The
default is the basename of _argv[0]_.

*-e env [..]*::
This option names any number of environment variables, whose value
should be reported as part of the data dump. By default, no environment
variables are reported.

*-i infile [..]*::
The *pegasus-keg* binary can work on any number of input files. For each
output file, every input file will be opened, and its content copied to
the output file. Textual input files are assumed. Each input line is
indented by two spaces. The input file content is bracketed between an
start and end section, see below. By default, *pegasus-keg* operates in
_generator_ mode.

*-l logfile*::
The _logfile_ is the name of a file to append atomically the self-info,
see below. The atomic write guarantees that the multi-line information
will not interleave with other processes that simultaneously write to
the same file. The default is not to use any log file.

*-o outfile [..]*::
The *pegasus-keg* can work on any number of output files. For each
output file, every input file will be opened, and its content copied
to the output file. Textual input files are assumed. Each input line
is indented by two spaces. The input file content is bracketed between
an start and end section, see 2nd example. After all input files are
copied, the data dump from this instance of *pegasus-keg* is appended to
the output file. Without output files, *pegasus-keg* operates in _data
sink_ mode.

*-G size*::
If you want *pegasus-keg* to generate a lot of output, the generator
option will do that for you. Just specify how much, in bytes, you want.
This option is off by default.

*-C*::
This option causes *pegasus-keg* to list all environment variables that
start with the prefix _\_CONDOR_ The option is useful, if .B pegasus-keg
is run as (part of) a Condor job. This option is off by default.

*-p string [..]*::
Any number of parameters can be reported, without being specific
on their content. Effectively, these strings are copied straight from
the command line. By default, no extra arguments are shown.

*-P prefix*::
Each line from every input file is indented with a prefix string to
visually emphasize the provenance of an input files through multiple
instances of *pegasus-keg*. By default, two spaces are used as prefix
string.

*-t interval*::
The interval is an amount of sleep time that the *pegasus-keg*
executable is to sleep. This can be used to emulate light work without
straining the pool resources. If used together with the *-T* spin
option, the sleep interval comes before the spin interval. The default
is no sleep time.

*-T interval*::
The interval is an amount of busy spin time that the *pegasus-keg*
executable is to simulate intense computation. The simulation is done
by random julia set calculations. This option can be used to emulate an
intense work to strain pool resources. If used together with the *-t*
sleep option, the sleep interval comes before the spin interval. The
default is no spin time.


Return Value
------------

Execution as planned will return 0. The failure to open an input file
will return 1, the failure to open an output file, including the log
file, will return with exit code 2.


Example
-------

The example shows the bracketing of an input file, and the copy
produced on the output file. For illustration purposes, the output
file is connected to _stdout_ :

Restrictions
------------

The input file must be textual files. The behaviour with binary files
is unspecified.

The host address is determined from the primary interface. If there is
no active interface besides loopback, the host address will default
to 0.0.0.0. If the host address is within a _virtual private network_
address range, only _(VPN)_ will be displayed as hostname, and no
reverse address lookup will be attempted.

The 
_processor info_
line is only available on Linux systems. The line will be missing on
other operating systems. Its information is assuming symmetrical multi
processing, reflecting the CPU name and speed of the last CPU available
in 
_/dev/cpuinfo_ .


There is a limit of 
_4 * page size_
to the output buffer of things that
.B pegasus-keg
can report in its self-info dump. There is no such restriction on the
input to output file copy.
