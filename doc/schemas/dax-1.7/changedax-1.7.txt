CHANGELOG 
=========

DAX 1.6 -> 1.7
--------------

o Added adag@version at Karan's request to help maintain parsability
  for both version of documents.

o Added adag/job@compound to record the list of compound transformations
  that resulted in producing this job. This is an optional multivalue
  attribute. 

o Added adag/job/profile@origin to record the entity responsible for
  including this profile element into the DAX. Conceivable values from
  Chimera are "vdl", "vo" and "user", from Pegasus "tc", "pc" and "vo". 

o Introduced new complex type StdioType to add the notion of the VDL's 
  variable name which was responsible for generating the stdio LFN. This
  is the attribute adag/job/std*@varname. 

o The transfer mode is tri-state instead of boolean; added as simple type.
