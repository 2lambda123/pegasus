CHANGELOG
=========

IV 1.1 -> 1.2
-------------

o Moved the JobType/cwd to invocation/cwd, because the current
  working directory is specific to gridstart, but not beyond. All it's
  jobs will be started with that particular working directory - it is
  not job specific. 

o Added the "channel" stat to invocation/statcall for the feedback
  channel.

o Augmented another filetype StatCallType/fifo to record filename and
  descriptor of the fifo, as well as the number of message, and bytes
  going in and out (out refers to stderr, the app. channel). 

o Changed invocation/mainjob to optional, as it may not execute, if
  the prejob failed. Of the eight permutations with the existence of
  pre-, main- and postjob, only six are valid.

o Added independent optional job invocation/cleanup.

o Added architecture information as invocation/uname. This includes
  a highly platform dependent archmode, which currently supports
  Linux IA (IA32, IA64) and SunOS SPARC (ILP32, LP64). 

o deprecated JobType/command-line@executable, because the file info
  is already stored in JobType/statcall/file@name.
