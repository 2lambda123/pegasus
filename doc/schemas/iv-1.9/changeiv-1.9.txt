CHANGELOG
=========

IV 1.8 -> 1.9
-------------

o Move invocation/environment to the end of the list. This may
  break old invocation records that are parsed with the new schema.
o Added invocation/resource with children resource/soft and
  resource/hard to record the soft- and hard resource limit
  from the environment. 
o Added optional attributes to the usage elements to complete the
  all possibilities.
o Changed the schema's URI to "http://vds.isi.edu/invocation".

IV 1.7 -> 1.8
-------------

o Added optional StatInfoType/statinfo@blocks element after fixing
  stat info records in kickstart.

IV 1.6 -> 1.7
-------------

o Fixed JobType/status/failure@error type to permit -255.
o Extended JobType to permit either compatible old-style arguments
  child element, or new-style argument-vector element with separate
  entries for each argv[] entry. This aides debugging greatly, and
  will be produced by kickstart. 
o Added invocation/environment element, which records the current
  environment settings as found by kickstart. Each entry is recorded
  into an invocation/environment/env child. 

IV 1.5 -> 1.6
-------------

o Added root attributes invocation@wf-label and invocation@wf-stamp
  to reflect the DAX's workflow label and the DAX file's last mod.
  time.

IV 1.4 -> 1.5
-------------

o Added optional attribute statinfo@lfn to provide information on 
  LFN to PFN mappings in the record.

o synchronized kickstart with schema. The element that captures the
  CLI arguments of a job is now called job/arguments, which is what
  kickstart has been producing for a while now. 

IV 1.2 -> 1.4
-------------

o Note: IV 1.3 is used for the prototypical implementation of k.2,
  the successor to kickstart. It will change to use IV 2.0

o Added a setup job. 

o Added symbolic information for hostaddress, uid and gid into 
  root element.

o Added symbolic information for uid and gid to each stat info.

o Permitted an arbitrary number of stat calls to accumulate in the end. 

IV 1.1 -> 1.2
-------------

o Moved the JobType/cwd to invocation/cwd, because the current
  working directory is specific to gridstart, but not beyond. All it's
  jobs will be started with that particular working directory - it is
  not job specific. 

o Added the "channel" stat to invocation/statcall for the feedback
  channel.

o Augmented another filetype StatCallType/fifo to record filename and
  descriptor of the fifo, as well as the number of message, and bytes
  going in and out (out refers to stderr, the app. channel). 

o Changed invocation/mainjob to optional, as it may not execute, if
  the prejob failed. Of the eight permutations with the existence of
  pre-, main- and postjob, only six are valid.

o Added independent optional job invocation/cleanup.

o Added architecture information as invocation/uname. This includes
  a highly platform dependent archmode, which currently supports
  Linux IA (IA32, IA64) and SunOS SPARC (ILP32, LP64). 

o deprecated JobType/command-line@executable, because the file info
  is already stored in JobType/statcall/file@name.
