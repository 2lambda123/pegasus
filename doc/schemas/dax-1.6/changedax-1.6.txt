CHANGELOG 
=========

DAX 1.5 -> 1.6
--------------

o Introduced a new complex type PlainFilenameType that just contains a
  name. 

o The initial list of filenames adag/filename which is used by a DAG now
  consists of the filename with the link attribute. No transient
  markers.

o The adag/job/argument/filename and adag/job/profile/filename inside a
  job only consist of the logical filename, referencing the
  PlainFilenameType. Neither linkage nor transiency is marked.

o The adag/job/stdio handles similarily only point to a filename and
  have a fixed linkage attached.

o The adag/job/uses list has the full per-job file information,
  including linkage and transiency of each file. Output files that 
  are not transient are expected to be transferred and registered.

o A job has the new extra, currently optional, attributes that allow to
  specify the DV a job was derived from: adag/job@dv-namespace,
  adag/job@dv-name, and adag/job@dv-version are a FQDI of the derivation
  pertaining to the job.

o split adag/job/uses@isTemporary into two separate attributes
  adag/job/uses@dontTransfer and adag/job/uses@dontRegister attributes.
  Support for isTemporary will be dropped (soon). Applications should
  regard isTemporary as mutually exclusive to the presence of
  dontRegister and dontTransfer. isTemporary with a true value should
  be interpreted as dontRegister and dontTransfer with a true value
  each.

o added an optional attribute adag/job@level which represents the 
  recursion depth during routing (abstract planning).
