CHANGELOG 
=========

DAX 1.9 -> 1.10
---------------

o Added profile namespace "selector".

o Reverted to original ordering of sections.

DAX 1.8 -> 1.9
--------------

o Changed container for adag/filename, adag/job and adag/child from a
  sequence to an "all" container. This way, the order is not specified.
  However, it is strongly advisable to dump each of the three major
  sections together, and to avoid interleaving. 

o Added optional attribute adag@jobCount to reflect the number of
  adag/job elements. This cannot be zero.

o Added optional attribute adag@fileCount to reflect the number of
  adag/filename elements. This may be zero.

o Added optional attribute adag@childCount to reflect the number of
  adag/child elements. This may be zero.

DAX 1.7 -> 1.8
--------------

o Added boolean attribute adag/filename@optional to denote optional
  files which must not result in workflow failure, if they are not in
  the replica catalog.

o Added boolean attribute "optional" to the full filename specification
  to denote optional files.
