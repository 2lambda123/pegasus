    <title>Executable Workflows (DAG)</title>

    <para>The DAG is an executable (concrete) workflow that can be executed over
    a variety of resources. When the workflow tasks are mapped to multiple
    resources that do not share a file system, explicit nodes are added to the
    workflow for orchestrating data. transfer between the tasks.</para>

    <para>When you take the DAX workflow created in <link linkend="creating_workflows">Creating Workflows</link>, and plan it for a single
    remote grid execution, here a site with handle <emphasis role="bold">hpcc</emphasis>,
    and plan the workflow without clean-up nodes, the following concrete
    workflow is built:</para>

    <para>Planning augments the original abstract workflow with ancillary
    tasks to facility the proper execution of the workflow. These tasks
    include:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>the creation of remote working directories. These directories
        typically have name that seeks to avoid conflicts with other
        simultaneously running similar workflows. Such tasks use a job prefix
        of <code>create_dir</code>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the stage-in of input files before any task which requires these
        files. Any file consumed by a task needs to be staged to the task, if
        it does not already exist on that site. Such tasks use a job prefix of
        <code>stage_in</code>.If multiple files from various sources need to
        be transferred, multiple stage-in jobs will be created. Additional
        advanced options permit to control the size and number of these jobs,
        and whether multiple compute tasks can share stage-in jobs.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the original DAX job is concretized into a compute task in the
        DAG. Compute jobs are a concatination of the job's
        <emphasis role="bold">name</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">id</emphasis> attribute from
        the DAX file.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the stage-out of data products to a collecting site. Data
        products with their <emphasis role="bold">transfer</emphasis> flag set to
        <literal>false</literal> will not be staged to the output site.
        However, they may still be eligible for staging to other, dependent
        tasks. Stage-out tasks use a job prefix of
        <code>stage_out</code>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If compute jobs run at different sites, an intermediary staging
        task with prefix <code>stage_inter</code> is inserted between the
        compute jobs in the workflow, ensuring that the data products of the
        parent are available to the child job.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the registration of data products in a replica catalog. Data
        products with their <emphasis role="bold">register</emphasis> flag set to

    <para>During the mapping process, the abstract workflow undergoes a series
    of refinement steps that converts it to an executable form.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Data Reuse</title>

      <para>The abstract workflow after parsing is optionally handed over to
      the Data Reuse Module. The Data Reuse Algorithm in Pegasus attempts to
      prune all the nodes in the abstract workflow for which the output files
      exist in the Replica Catalog. It also attempts to cascade the deletion
      to the parents of the deleted node for e.g if the output files for the
      leaf nodes are specified, Pegasus will prune out all the workflow as the
      output files in which a user is interested in already exist in the
      Replica Catalog.</para>

      <para>The Data Reuse Algorithm works in two passes</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">First Pass</emphasis> - Determine all the
      jobs whose output files exist in the Replica Catalog. An output file
      with the transfer flag set to false is treated equivalent to the file
      existing in the Replica Catalog , if the output file is not an input to
      any of the children of the job X.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Second Pass</emphasis> - The algorithm
      removes the job whose output files exist in the Replica Catalog and
      tries to cascade the deletion upwards to the parent jobs. We start the
      breadth first traversal of the workflow bottom up.</para>

      <programlisting>( It is already marked for deletion in Pass 1
     OR
      ( ALL of it's children have been marked for deletion
        AND
        Node's output files have transfer flags set to false
       )
 )</programlisting>

      <para>The abstract workflow is then handed over to the Site Selector
      module where the abstract jobs in the pruned workflow are mapped to the
      various sites passed by a user. The target sites for planning are
      specified on the command line using the<emphasis role="bold">
      --sites</emphasis> option to pegasus-plan. If not specified, then
      Pegasus picks up all the sites in the Site Catalog as candidate sites.

              <para>The jobs will be assigned in a round robin manner amongst
              the sites that can execute them. Since each site cannot execute
              every type of job, the round robin scheduling is done per level
              on a sorted list. The sorting is on the basis of the number of
              jobs a particular site has been assigned in that level so far.
              If a job cannot be run on the first site in the queue (due to no
              matching entry in the transformation catalog for the
              transformation referred to by the job), it goes to the next one
              and so on. This implementation defaults to classic round robin
              in the case where all the jobs in the workflow can run on all
              the sites.</para>

              particular group. The jobs that do not have the profile key
              associated with them, will be put in the default group. The jobs

              The implementation assumes default data communication costs when

      <para>After job clustering, the workflow is handed to the Data Transfer
      module that adds data stage-in , inter site and stage-out nodes to the
      workflow. Data Stage-in Nodes transfer input data required by the
      workflow from the locations specified in the Replica Catalog to a
      directory on the execution site where the job executes. In case,
      multiple locations are specified for the same input file, the location
      from where to stage the data is selected using a <emphasis
      role="bold">Replica Selector</emphasis> . Replica Selection is described
      in detail in the Replica Selection section of the <link

      <para>The process of adding the data stage-in and data stage-out nodes
      is handled by Transfer Refiners. All data transfer jobs in Pegasus are
      executed using <emphasis role="bold">pegasus-transfer</emphasis> . The
      pegasus-transfer client is a python based wrapper around various
      transfer clients like globus-url-copy, lcg-copy, wget, cp, ln . It looks
      at source and destination url and figures out automatically which
      underlying client to use. pegasus-transfer is distributed with the
      PEGASUS and can be found in the bin subdirectory . Pegasus Transfer
      Refiners are are described in the detail in the Transfers section of the
      <link linkend="reference">Reference Manual</link>. The default transfer
      refiner that is used in Pegasus is the <emphasis
      role="bold">Bundle</emphasis> Transfer Refiner, that bundles data
      stage-in nodes and data stage-out nodes on the basis of certain pegasus
      profile keys associated with the workflow.</para>

      creates one workflow specific directory per compute site , that is on
      the shared filesystem of compute site. This directory is visible to all
      the worker nodes and that is where the data is staged-in by the data
      stage-in jobs.</para>

      <para>After addition of the create dir jobs, the workflow is optionally
      handed to the cleanup module. The cleanup module adds cleanup nodes to

<note><para>
Values rely on proper capitalization, unless explicitly
noted otherwise.
</para></note>

<para>Some properties rely with their default on the value of other
properties. For example, curly braces refer to the value of the
named property. For instance, <emphasis role="bold">${pegasus.home}</emphasis>  means that the value depends
on the value of the <emphasis/> pegasus.home property plus any noted additions. You
can use this notation to refer to other properties, though the extent
of the subsitutions are limited. Usually, it isa best to refer to a set
of the standard system properties. Nesting is not allowed, and substitutions shall only be done once.
</para>

<para>There is a priority to the order of reading and evaluating properties.
Usually there is no need to worry about the priorities. However, it
is good to know the details of when which property applies, and how
one property is able to overwrite another.
</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>Property definitions in the system property file,
usually found in <emphasis>${pegasus.home.sysconfdir}/properties</emphasis>, have the
lowest priority. These properties are expected to be set up by the submit
host's administrator.</listitem>
<listitem>The properties defined in the user property file
<emphasis>${user.home}/.pegasusrc</emphasis> have higher priority. These can overwrite
settings found in the system's properties. A set of sensible property
values to set on a production system is shown below.</listitem>
<listitem>Commandline properties have the highest priority. Each
commandline property is introduced by a -D argument. Note that these arguments
are parsed by the shell wrapper, and thus the -D arguments must be the first
arguments to any command. Commandline properties are useful for debugging
purposes.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

RLS (Replica Location Service) is a distributed replica
catalog, which ships with GT4. There is an index service called
Replica Location Index (RLI) to which 1 or more Local Replica
Catalog (LRC) report. Each LRC can contain all or a subset of
mappings. In this mode, Pegasus queries the central RLI to
discover in which LRC's the mappings for a LFN reside. It then
queries the individual LRC's for the PFN's.
To use RLS, the user additionally needs to set the property
pegasus.catalog.replica.url to specify the URL for the RLI to
query.

    <title>Execution Environments</title>

    <para>Pegasus supports a number of execution environments. An execution
    environment is a setup where jobs from a workflow are running.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The simplest execution environment does not involve Condor.
        Pegasus is capable of planning small workflows for full-local
        execution using a shell planner. Please refer to the <filename
        class="directory">examples</filename> directory in your Pegasus
        installation, the shell planner's <link
        linkend="local_shell_examples">documentation section</link>, or the
        tutorials, for details.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A slighly more challenging setup is still all-local, but Condor
        manages queued jobs and Condor DAGMan the workflow. This setup permits
        limited parallelism with full scalability. With proper setup, Condor
        can scavenge cycles from unused computers in your department, enabling
        a pool of more than just a single machine.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The vanilla setup are workflows to be executed in a grid
        environment. This setup requires a number of configurations, and an
        understanding of remote sites.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Various advanced execution environment setups deal with
        minimally using Globus to obtain remote resources (Glide-ins),
        by-passing Globus completely (Condor-C), or supporting cloud computing

      <para>The vanilla grid environment shown in the figure <link
      linkend="concepts-fig-site-layout">above</link>. We will work from the
      left to the right top, then the right bottom.</para>

      <para>On the left side, you have a submit machine where Pegasus runs,
      Condor schedules jobs, and workflows are executed. We call it the
      <emphasis>submit host</emphasis> (SH), though its functionality can be
      assumed by a virtual machine image. In order to properly communicate
      over secured channels, it is important that the submit machine has a
      proper notion of time, i.e. runs an NTP daemon to keep accurate time. To
      be able to connect to remote clusters and receive connections from the
      remote clusters, the submit host has a public IP address to facilitate
      this communication.</para>

      <para>In order to send a job request to the remote cluster, Condor wraps
      the job into Globus calls via Condor-G. Globus uses GRAM to manage jobs
      on remote sites. In terms of a software stack, Pegasus wraps the job
      into Condor. Condor wraps the job into Globus. Globus transports the job
      to the remote site, and unwraps the Globus component, sending it to the
      remote site's <emphasis>resource manager</emphasis> (RM).</para>

      <para>To be able to communicate using the Globus security infrastructure
      (GSI), the submit machine needs to have the certificate authority (CA)
      certificates configured, requires a host certificate in certain
      circumstances, and the user a user certificate that is enabled on the
      remote site. On the remote end, the remote gatekeeper node requires a
      host certificate, all signing CA certificate chains and policy files,
      and a goot time source.</para>

      <para>In a grid environment, there are one or more clusters accessible
      via grid middleware like the <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/">Globus
      Toolkit</ulink>. In case of Globus, there is the Globus gatekeeper
      listening on TCP port 2119 of the remote cluster. The port is opened to
      a single machine called <emphasis>head node</emphasis> (HN).The
      head-node is typically located in a de-militarized zone (DMZ) of the
      firewall setup, as it requires limited outside connectivity and a public
      IP address so that it can be contacted. Additionally, once the
      gatekeeper accepted a job, it passes it on to a jobmanager. Often, these
      jobmanagers require a limited port range, in the example TCP ports
      40000-41000, to call back to the submit machine.</para>

      <para>For the user to be able to run jobs on the remote site, the user
      must have some form of an account on the remtoe site. The user's grid
      identity is passed from the submit host. An entity called <emphasis>grid
      mapfile</emphasis> on the gatekeeper maps the user's grid identity into
      a remote account. While most sites do not permit account sharing, it is
      possible to map multiple user certificates to the same account.</para>

      <para>The gatekeeper is the interface through which jobs are submitted
      to the remote cluster's resource manager. A resource manager is a
      scheduling system like PBS, Maui, LSF, FBSNG or Condor that queues tasks
      and allocates worker nodes. The <emphasis>worker nodes</emphasis> (WN)
      in the remote cluster might not have outside connectivity and often use
      all private IP addresses. The Globus toolkit requires a shared
      filesystem to properly stage files between the head node and worker
      nodes.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The shared filesystem requirement is imposed by Globus. Pegasus
        is capable of supporting advanced site layouts that do not require a
        shared filesystem. Please contact us for details, should you require
        such a setup.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To stage data between external sites for the job, it is
      recommended to enable a GridFTP server. If a shared networked filesystem
      is involved, the GridFTP server should be located as close to the
      file-server as possible. The GridFTP server requires TCP port 2811 for
      the control channel, and a limited port range for data channels, here as
      an example the TPC ports from 40000 to 41000. The GridFTP server
      requires a host certificate, the signing CA chain and policy files, a
      stable time source, and a gridmap file that maps between a user's grid
      identify and the user's account on the remote site.</para>

      <para>The GridFTP server is often installed on the head node, the same
      as the gatekeeper, so that they can share the grid mapfile, CA
      certificate chains and other setups. However, for performance purposes
      it is recommended that the GridFTP server has its own machine.</para>

      </para>

      <para>The pevious figure shows a sample layout for sky computing (as in:
      multiple clouds) as supported by Pegasus. At this point, it is up to the
      user to provision the remote resources with a proper VM image that
      includes a Condor startd and proper Condor configuration to report back
      to a Condor collector that the Condor schedd has access to.</para>

      <para>In this discussion, the <emphasis>submit host</emphasis> (SH) is
      located logically external to the cloud provider(s). The SH is the point
      where a user submits Pegasus workflows for execution. This site
      typically runs a Condor collector to gather resource announcements, or
      is part of a larger Condor pool that collects these announcement. Condor
      makes the remote resources available to the submit host&amp;rsquor;s Condor
      installation.</para>

      <para>The <link linkend="concepts-fig-cloud-layout">figure above</link>
      shows the way Pegasus WMS is deployed in cloud computing resources,
      ignoring how these resources were provisioned. The provisioning request
      shows multiple resources per provisioning request.</para>

      <para>The provisioning broker -- Nimbus, Eucalyptus or EC2 -- at the
      remote site is responsible to allocate and set up the resources. For a
      multi-node request, the worker nodes often require access to a form of
      shared data storage. Concretely, either a POSIX-compliant shared file
      system (e.g. NFS, PVFS) is available to the nodes, or can be brought up
      for the lifetime of the application workflow. The task steps of the
      application workflow facilitate shared file systems to exchange
      intermediary results between tasks on the same cloud site. Pegasus also
      supports an S3 data mode for the application workflow data
      staging.</para>

      <para>The initial stage-in and final stage-out of application data into
      and out of the node set is part of any Pegasus-planned workflow. Several
      configuration options exist in Pegasus to deal with the dynamics of push
      and pull of data, and when to stage data. In many use-cases, some form
      of external access to or from the shared file system that is visible to
      the application workflow is required to facilitate successful data
      staging. However, Pegasus is prepared to deal with a set of boundary
      cases.</para>

      <para>The data server in the figure is shown at the submit host. This is
      not a strict requirement. The data server for consumed data and data
      products may both be different and external to the submit host.</para>

      <para>Once resources begin appearing in the pool managed by the submit
      machine&amp;rsquor;s Condor collector, the application workflow can be
      submitted to Condor. A Condor DAGMan will manage the application
      workflow execution. Pegasus run-time tools obtain timing-, performance
      and provenance information as the application workflow is executed. At
      this point, it is the user's responsibility to de-provision the
      allocated resources.</para>

      <para>In the figure, the cloud resources on the right side are assumed
      to have uninhibited outside connectivity. This enables the Condor I/O to
      communicate with the resources. The right side includes a setup where
      the worker nodes use all private IP, but have out-going connectivity and
      a NAT router to talk to the internet. The <emphasis>Condor connection
      broker</emphasis> (CCB) facilitates this setup almost
      effortlessly.</para>

      <para>The left side shows a more difficult setup where the connectivity
      is fully firewalled without any connectivity except to in-site nodes. In
      this case, a proxy server process, the <emphasis>generic connection
      broker</emphasis> (GCB), needs to be set up in the DMZ of the cloud site
      to facilitate Condor I/O between the submit host and worker
      nodes.</para>

      <para>If the cloud supports data storage servers, Pegasus is starting to
      support workflows that require staging in two steps: Consumed data is
      first staged to a data server in the remote site's DMZ, and then a
      second staging task moves the data from the data server to the worker
      node where the job runs. For staging out, data needs to be first staged
      from the job's worker node to the site's data server, and possibly from
      there to another data server external to the site. Pegasus is capable to
      plan both steps: Normal staging to the site's data server, and the
      worker-node staging from and to the site's data server as part of the
      job. We are working on expanding the current code to support a more
      generic set by Pegasus 3.1.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Shared File Systems</title>

        <para>Ideally, any allocation of multiple resources shares a file
        system among them. This can be either a globally shared file system
        like NFS, or a per-request file system dynamically allocated like PVFS
        or NFS. Often, for the sake of speed, it is advisable that each
        resource has its own fast local non-shared disk space that can be
        transiently used by application workflow jobs.</para>

        <para>Pegasus recommends the use of a shared file system, because it
        simplifies workflows and may even improve performance. Without shared
        file system, the same data may need to be staged to the same site but
        different resources multiple times. Without shared file systems, data
        products of a parent job need to be staged out, and staged back in to
        the child job, currently via an external data server, even if parent

        <para>The Pegasus team explores the option of dynamically bringing up
        an NFS server on one resource of a multi-resource allocation for the
        duration of the allocation. This option is part of the configuration
        for an experiment&amp;rsquor;s workflow&amp;rsquor;s provisioning stage. We do
        not expect cloud sites to ban NFS and RPC traffic between resources of
        the same multi-resource allocation.</para>

    <title>Resource Configurations</title>

    <para>This section discusses the various resource configurations that can
    be used with Pegasus when Condor DAGMan is used as the workflow execution
    engine. It is assumed that there is a submit host where the workflow is
    submitted for execution. The following classification is done based the
    mechanism used for submitting jobs to the Grid resources and monitoring
    them. The classifications explored in this document are using Globus GRAM
    and using a Condor pool. Both of the configurations use Condor DAGMan to
    maintain the dependencies between the jobs, but differ in the manner as to
    how the jobs are launched. A combination of the above mentioned approach
    is also possible where some of the tasks in the workflow are executed in
    the Condor pool and the rest are executed on remote resources using
    Condor-G.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Locally on the Submit Host</title>

      <para>In this configuration , Pegasus schedules the jobs to run locally
      on the submit host. This is achieved by executing the workflow on site
      local ( <emphasis role="bold">--sites local </emphasis>option to
      pegasus-plan ). The <emphasis role="bold">site "local" is a reserved
      site</emphasis> in Pegasus and results in the jobs to run on the submit
      host in condor universe local.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Using Globus GRAM</title>

      <para>In this configuration, it is assumed that the target execution
      system consists of one or more Grid resources. These resources may be
      geographically distributed and under various administrative domains.
      Each resource might be a single desktop computer or a network of
      workstations (NOW) or a cluster of dedicated machines. However, each
      resource must provide a Globus GRAM interface which allows the users to
      submit jobs remotely. In case the Grid resource consists of multiple
      compute nodes, e.g. a cluster or a network of workstations, there is a
      central entity called the head node that acts as the single point of job
      submissions to the resource. It is generally possible to specify whether
      the submitted job should run on the head node of the resource or a
      worker node in the cluster or NOW. In the latter case, the head node is
      responsible for submitting the job to a local resource management system
      (PBS, LSF, Condor etc) which controls all the machines in the resource.
      Since, the head node is the central point of job submissions to the
      resource it should not be used for job execution since that can overload
      the head node delaying further job submissions. Pegasus does not make
      any assumptions about the configuration of the remote resource; rather
      it provides the mechanisms by which such distinctions can be
      made.</para>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>In this configuration, Condor-G is used for submitting jobs to
      these resources. Condor-G is an extension to Condor that allows the jobs
      to be described in a Condor submit file and when the job is submitted to
      Condor for execution, it uses the Globus GRAM interface to submit the
      job to the remote resource and monitor its execution. The distinction is
      made in the Condor submit files by specify the universe as Grid and the
      grid_resource or globusscheduler attribute is used to indicate the
      location of the head node for the remote resource. Thus, Condor DAGMan
      is used for maintaining the dependencies between the jobs and Condor-G
      is used to launch the jobs on the remote resources using GRAM. The
      implicit assumption in this case is that all the worker nodes on a
      remote resource have access to a shared file system that can be used for
      data transfer between the tasks mapped on that resource. This data
      transfer is done using files.</para>

      <title>Condor Pool</title>

      <para>A Condor pool is a set of machines that use Condor for resource
      management. A Condor pool can be a cluster of dedicated machines or a
      set of distributively owned machines. Pegasus can generate concrete
      workflows that can be executed on a Condor pool.</para>

        pool.</title>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The workflow is submitted using DAGMan from one of the job
      submission machines in the Condor pool. It is the responsibility of the
      Central Manager of the pool to match the task in the workflow submitted
      by DAGMan to the execution machines in the pool. This matching process
      can be guided by including Condor specific attributes in the submit
      files of the tasks. If the user wants to execute the workflow on the
      execution machines (worker nodes) in a Condor pool, there should be a
      resource defined in the site catalog which represents these execution
      machines. The universe attribute of the resource should be vanilla.
      There can be multiple resources associated with a single Condor pool,
      where each resource identifies a subset of machine (worker nodes) in the
      pool. Pegasus currently uses the FileSystemDomain classad[] attribute to
      restrict the set of machines that make up a single resource. To clarify
      this point, suppose there are certain execution machines in the Condor
      pool whose FileSystemDomain is set to &amp;ldquo;viz.isi.edu&amp;rdquor;. If the
      user wants to execute the workflow on these machines, then there should
      be a site, say &amp;ldquo;isi_viz&amp;rdquor; defined in the site catalog and
      the FileSystemDomain and universe attributes for this resource should be
      defined as &amp;ldquo;viz.isi.edu&amp;rdquor; and &amp;ldquo;vanilla&amp;rdquor;
      respectively. When invoking Pegasus, the user should select isi_viz as
      the compute resource.</para>

      <title>Condor Glideins</title>

      <para>Pegasus WMS can execute workflows over Condor pool. This pool can
      contain machines managed by a single institution or department and
      belonging to a single administrative domain. This is the case for most
      of the Condor pools. In this section we describe how machines from
      different administrative domains and supercomputing centers can be
      dynamically added to a Condor pool for certain timeframe. These machines
      join the Condor pool temporarily and can be used to execute jobs in a
      non preemptive manner. This functionality is achieved using a Condor
      feature called Glide-in http://cs.wisc.edu/condor/glidein that uses
      Globus GRAM interface for migrating machines from different domains to a
      Condor pool. The number of machines and the duration for which they are
      required can be specified</para>

      <para>In this case, we use the abstraction of a local Condor pool to
      execute the jobs in the workflow over remote resources that have joined
      the pool for certain timeframe. Details about the use of this feature
      can be found in the condor manual
      (http://cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/).</para>

      <para>A basic step to migrate in a job to a local condor pool is
      described below.</para>

        <emphasis role="bold">GlideIn of Remote Globus Resources</emphasis>
      </para>

      <para>The above step glides in 10 nodes to the user&amp;rsquor;s local
      condor pool, from the remote pbs scheduler running at
      gatekeeper.site.edu. By default, the glide in binaries are installed in
      the users home directory on the remote host.</para>

      <para>It is possible that the Condor pool can contain resources from
      multiple Grid sites. It is normally the case that the resources from a
      particular site share the same file system and thus use the same
      FileSystemDomain attribute while advertising their presence to the
      Central Manager of the pool. If the user wants to run his jobs on
      machines from a particular Grid site, he has to specify the
      FileSystemDomain attribute in the requirements classad expression in the
      submit files with a value matching the FileSystemDomain of the machines
      from that site. For example, the user migrates nodes from the ISI
      cluster (with FileSystemDomain viz.isi.org) into a Condor pool and
      specifies FileSystemDomain == &amp;ldquo;viz.isi.edu&amp;rdquor;. Condor would
      then schedule the jobs only on the nodes from the ISI VIZ cluster in the
      local condor pool. The FileSystemDomain can be specified for an
      execution site in the site catalog with condor profile namespace as
      follows</para>

        environment in Amazon. The easiest way is to use a submit machine
        outside the cloud, and to provision several worker nodes and a file
        server node in the cloud as shown here:</para>

        schedd, negotiator),the workers run a Condor startd, and the file
        server node exports an NFS file system. The workers' startd is
        configured to connect to the master running outside the cloud. The
        worker also mounts the NFS file system. More information on setting up
        Condor for this environment can be found at <ulink

        <title>Using S3 for intermediate files</title>

        <note>
          <para>This section describes how to use the legacy support for S3
          that exists in Pegasus 2.4.x and 3.0. In Pegasus 3.1, support for S3
          will be added to pegasus-transfer.</para>
        </note>

        <para>This section will show you how to use S3 to store intermediate
        files. In this mode, Pegasus transfers workflow inputs from the input
        site to S3 if they are not already in S3. When a job runs, the inputs
        for that job are fetched from S3 to the worker node, the job is
        executed, then the output files are transferred from the worker node
        back to S3. Finally, at the end of the workflow, the desired outputs
        are transferred from S3 to the output site. This is similar to how
        second-level staging works (SLS), and, in fact, the current S3
        implementation is an extension of SLS.</para>

        <para>In order to use S3 for your workflows, you need to first create
        a config file for the S3 transfer client, s3cmd. This config file
        needs to be installed on both the submit host, and the worker nodes.
        Save the file as 's3cmd.cfg'. This file will contain your Amazon
        security tokens, so you will want to set the permissions so that other
        users cannot read it (e.g. chmod 600 s3cmd.cfg). In the listing below,
        replace 'YOUR_AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_HERE' and
        'YOUR_AMAZON_SECRET_KEY_HERE' with your Amazon access key and secret
        key.</para>

        <para>Next, you need to modify your site catalog to tell s3cmd the
        path to your config file. You can do this by specifying an environment
        variable called S3CFG using an 'env' profile. This needs to be added
        to both the 'local' site, and any execution sites where you want to
        use S3. This environment variable will be used by s3cmd in the S3
        transfer jobs to locate the config file.</para>

        <para>Next, you need to update your pegasus.properties file to tell
        Pegasus to turn on SLS, to use S3 for first and second-level staging,
        and to create and delete buckets. The pegasus.gridstart property tells
        pegasus to use seqexec, which allows the application jobs to be
        wrapped with S3 PUT and GET commands to retrieve and store input and
        output data.</para>

pegasus.gridstart = SeqExecOld                  # Use the old seqexec implementation</programlisting>

        <para>Next, you need to add an entry for amazon::s3cmd in your
        transformation catalog. The s3cmd executable is in the
        PEGASUS_HOME/bin directory.</para>
