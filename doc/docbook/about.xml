    <title>Overview and Features</title>

    <para><ulink url="http://pegasus.isi.edu">Pegasus WMS</ulink> is a
    configurable system for mapping and executing abstract application
    workflows over a wide range of execution environment including a laptop, a
    campus cluster, a Grid, or a commercial or academic cloud. Today, Pegasus
    runs workflows on Amazon EC2, Nimbus, Open Science Grid, the TeraGrid, and
    many campus clusters. One workflow can run on a single system or across a
    heterogeneous set of resources. Pegasus can run workflows ranging from
    just a few computational tasks up to 1 million.</para>

    <para>Pegasus WMS bridges the scientific domain and the execution
    environment by automatically mapping high-level workflow descriptions onto
    distributed resources. It automatically locates the necessary input data
    and computational resources necessary for workflow execution. Pegasus
    enables scientists to construct workflows in abstract terms without
    worrying about the details of the underlying execution environment or the
    particulars of the low-level specifications required by the middleware
    (Condor, Globus, or Amazon EC2). Pegasus WMS also bridges the current
    cyberinfrastructure by effectively coordinating multiple distributed
    resources. The input to Pegasus is a description of the abstract workflow
    in XML format.</para>

    <para>Pegasus allows researchers to translate complex computational tasks
    into workflows that link and manage ensembles of dependent tasks and
    related data files. Pegasus automatically chains dependent tasks together,
    so that a single scientist can complete complex computations that once
    required many different people. New users are encouraged to explore the
    <link linkend="walkthrough">New User Walkthrough</link> chapter to become
    familiar with how to operate Pegasus for their own workflows. Users create
    and run a sample project to demonstrate Pegasus capabilities. Users can
    also browse the <link linkend="useful_tips">Useful Tips</link> chapter to
    aid them in designing their workflows.</para>

    <para>Pegasus has a number of features that contribute to its useability
    and effectiveness.</para>

        <para>User created workflows can easily be run in different environments without alteration.
        Pegasus currently runs workflows on Amazon EC2, Nimbus, Open Science Grid, the TeraGrid, and many campus clusters.

        The same workflow can run on a single system or across a heterogeneous set of resources.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Error Recovery</emphasis></para>

        <para>When errors occur, Pegasus tries to recover when possible by
        retrying tasks, by retrying the entire workflow, by providing
        workflow-level checkpointing, by re-mapping portions of the workflow,
        by trying alternative data sources for staging data, and, when all
        else fails, by providing a rescue workflow containing a description of
        only the work that remains to be done. It cleans up storage as the
        workflow is executed so that data-intensive workflows have enough
        space to execute on storage-constrained resource. Pegasus keeps track
        of what has been done (provenance) including the locations of data
        used and produced, and which software was used with which
        parameters.</para>

            <para><emphasis>Condor Pools and Glideins</emphasis></para>

            <para>Condor is a specialized workload management system for
            compute-intensive jobs. Condor queues workflows, schedules, and
            monitors the execution of each workflow. Condor Pools and Glideins
            are tools for submitting and executing the Condor daemons on a
            Globus resource. As long as the daemons continue to run, the
            remote machine running them appears as part of your Condor pool.
            What are the advatages to running in a Pool environment? For a
            more complete description of Condor, see the <ulink
