  found under <filename>$PEGASUS_HOME/examples/</filename></para>

  <section>
    <title>Grid Examples</title>

    <para>These examples assumes you have access to a cluster with Globus
    installed. A pre-ws gatekeeper and gridftp server is required. You also
    need Globus and Pegasus installed, both on the machine you are submitting
    from, and the cluster.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Black Diamond</title>

      <para>This is a sample workflow with 4 nodes, layed out in a diamond
      shape:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/examples-diamond.jpg"
                     valign="middle" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The binary for the nodes is a simple "mock application" name "keg"
      ("canonical example for the grid") which reads input files designated by
      arguments, writes them back onto output files, and produces on STDOUT a
      summary of where and when it was run. Keg ships with Pegasus in the bin
      directory.</para>

      <para>This example ships with a "submit" script which will build the
      replica catalog, the transformation catalog, and the site catalog. When
      you create your own workflows, such a submit script is not needed if you
      want to maintain those catalogs manually.</para>

      <para>To test the example, edit the "submit" script and change the
      cluster config to the setup and install locations for your cluster. Then
      run:</para>

      <para>./submit</para>

      <para>The workflow should now be submitted and in the output you should
      see a submit dir location for the instance. With that directory you can
      monitor the workflow with:</para>

      <para>pegasus-status [submitdir]</para>

      <para>Once the workflow is done, you can make sure it was sucessful
      with:</para>

      <para>pegasus-analyzer -d [submitdir]</para>
