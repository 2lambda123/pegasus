DO NOT USE THESE EXAMPLES!

I mean it -- don't complain to us, if test2 does not work!

--- old message ---

This test is an example for manipulating stdout of an application. In
order to get things to work, you must run the replanner on the output of
the concrete planner. 

Please note that you must enter an application in the gridstart column
of your pool.config file. Currently this application is "kickstart". The
gridstart column contains the complete path to kickstart on the remote
host.
