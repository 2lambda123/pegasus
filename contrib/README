graph-build: builds a graph image of an ant build file.

exitcode: This contains two scripts, "fixdag" to insert post-processing
  scripts into a gencdag-generated DAG, and "parse-exitcode" to process
  the kickstart results to determine job failure. This is an old version!

showlog: help display results from a DAG run

summary: summarizes a Condor DAGMan log file (or multiple ones), and
  print some elementary statistics about job and site performance.

gstar: A set of 'UNIX' like utilities for the Grid/Grid3.

qq: A simple script to give a more comprehensive output from condor_q. 
  This one is useful if you have grid jobs, but does not hurt with 
  plain Condor jobs, either.
