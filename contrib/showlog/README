The newly revamped show-run replaces show-chimera. There is one subtle
change in commandline options, which should make things easier:

   OLD STYLE                           NEW STYLE
   ---------                           ---------
   -b base (mandatory)                 -b base is optional
   -l clog (mandatory)                 log location is "found"

   n.a.                                -D dag file, mandatory

The show-run tool relies on a number of files: The .dag file, the .log
file that all your Condor jobs logged into, the .sub files and the .out
files produced by kickstart. The submit files will be found relative to
the base directory, from information inside the DAG file. The kickstart
output records are expected to be found in the same location.
