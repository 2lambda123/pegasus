NOTE: Do not copy and paste the commands below without double checking.
      The commands contain version numbers which are probably not 
      correct for what you are trying to do!
      

1.  Check out the branch. For example:

       svn co https://pegasus.isi.edu/svn/pegasus/branches/N.M N.M-branch

2.  Generate man pages documentation PDFs:

       ant doc

3.  Copy and check the PDFs in:

       cp dist/pegasus-*/share/doc/pegasus/html/*.pdf doc/
       svn commit -m "Updated man pages PDFs"

4.  Set the version number in Version.in and commit:

       vim ./src/edu/isi/pegasus/common/util/Version.in
       svn commit -m "Setting version for tag"

5.  Tag. Example:

      svn copy https://pegasus.isi.edu/svn/pegasus/branches/N.M \
               https://pegasus.isi.edu/svn/pegasus/tags/N.M.O

6.  Open branch for new checkins with new version:

       vim ./src/edu/isi/pegasus/common/util/Version.in
       svn commit -m "Branch reopen for checkins"

7.  Build using the NMI system.

8.  Copy the build binaries from nightlies to their final place.

9.  Build APT repo. First copy the debs into their final place in 
    the apt tree. Then run update-pegasus-apt-repo on a Debian
    machine. Note that Mats' Debian key is used to sign the
    repository, so currently he has to do this step.

10. Built Yum repo. Similar to Apt repo, but the step has to be
    done on a RHEL machine.

11. Update download page (and test the links!)

12. Send annouce email to pegasus-announce@mailman.isi.edu
    (Karan or Gaurang has to do this step)
