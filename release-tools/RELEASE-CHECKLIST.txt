NOTE: Do not copy and paste the commands below without double checking.
      The commands contain version numbers which are probably not 
      correct for what you are trying to do!
      

1.  Clone and move to the specific branch. For example:

       git clone https://github.com/pegasus-isi/pegasus.git
       cd pegasus
       git checkout N.M

2.  Set the version number in build.properties and commit:

       vim build.properties
       git commit -a -m "Setting version for tag"

3.  Tag. Example:

        git tag -a -m "Created tag for N.M.O" N.M.O

4.  Open branch for new checkins with new version:

       vim build.properties
       git commit -a -m "Branch reopen for checkins"

5.  Bring the branch back to master, but ignore the commits.

       git checkout master
       git merge --no-commit N.M
    (edit build.properties)
       git commit -a -m "Merged N.M"

6.  git push --tags

7.  Build with Bamboo

    done on a RHEL machine. Do this on workflow.

```

    to latest stable release
    https://pegasus.isi.edu/wms/docs/latest/
